Managed Cloud Security Service Reverse proxies are versatile tools that can be implemented in various scenarios to improve web application security, performance, and management. Enhanced Security: By hiding the origin server's IP address and other identifying information, a reverse proxy acts as a shield against direct attacks. A reverse proxy is used for load balancing, protection from attacks, global server load balancing (GSLB), caching, secure sockets layer (SSL) encryption, and live activity monitoring and logging. A reverse proxy can do this as well, but it also has security functions and provides for enhanced flexibility and scalability in ways that a load balancer cannot. Reverse proxies are used to increase security by hiding server details, improve performance through load balancing and caching, and provide centralized access control for web applications.

In computer networks, a reverse proxy or surrogate server is a proxy server that appears to any client to be an ordinary web server, but in reality merely acts as an intermediary that forwards the client's requests to one or more ordinary web servers.[1][2] Reverse proxies help increase scalability, performance, resilience, and security, but they also carry a number of risks. An important advantage of doing so is that the web servers can be hidden behind a firewall on a company-internal network, and only the reverse proxy needs to be directly exposed to the Internet. Large websites and content delivery networks use reverse proxies, together with other techniques, to balance the load between internal servers.

A reverse proxy sits in front of one or more web application servers, intercepting client requests. A reverse proxy enhances the security of web applications by hiding the details of the backend servers from the clients. Enhanced Security: By acting as an intermediary for requests from clients, reverse proxies can protect the web server from exposure. Reverse proxies can enhance the security of web applications by hiding the details of the backend servers from the clients. The reverse proxy forwards client requests to the appropriate backend application servers based on the configured rules. For instance, AppWall, a Web Application and API Protection (WAAP), operates as a reverse proxy and ensures fast, reliable and secure delivery of mission-critical web applications and APIs for corporate networks and in the cloud.

A Reverse Proxy Server, sometimes also called a reverse proxy web server, often a feature of a load balancing solution, stands between web servers and users, similar to a forward proxy. In these situations, a reverse proxy server could use the shielded server load as a basis for buffering incoming requests, transform one request into multiple requests to synthesize responses, handle data from cookies or sessions, or create HTTP requests from HTTPS requests, for example.

ssl and tls mutual authentication,"1. Two-way authentication: Both the client and server verify each other's identities using digital certificates, ensuring mutual trust.
2. Encrypted communication: Data transmitted between client and server is encrypted, protecting it from eavesdropping and tampering.
3. Certificate management: Involves the issuance, validation, and revocation of certificates, ensuring only trusted entities can communicate.
4. Integrity verification: Ensures that data has not been altered during transmission, maintaining data integrity.
5. Non-repudiation: Digital certificates provide a way to verify the identity of the parties involved, preventing them from denying their participation in the communication.","For most applications, SSL/TLS uses this sort of one-way authentication of a server to a client; an anonymous client (the web browser) negotiates an encrypted session with a web server, which presents a publicly trusted SSL/TLS certificate to identify itself during the SSL/TLS handshake: Mutual authentication, in which both server and client in the SSL/TLS session are authenticated, is also possible and can be very useful in some circumstances. All of SSL.com’s Email, Client, and Document Signing certificates include client authentication. As a further defense against phishing, all of SSL.com’s Email, Client, and Document Signing certificates include publicly trusted S/MIME for signed and encrypted email. Individuals or organizations requiring only one or a few certificates may order Email, Client, and Document Signing certificates á la carte from SSL.com.

Mutual Transport Layer Security (mTLS) allows two parties to authenticate each other during the initial connection of an SSL/TLS handshake.

mTLS offers a higher level of security than standard TLS because it requires both client and server to authenticate each other. While EAP-TLS is typically used in a LAN environment for network access control (like Wi-Fi authentication), mTLS is more common in protecting application-level communication over a WAN, such as securing HTTP traffic between a web browser and a server. mTLS provides an advanced level of security for data transmissions by implementing a mutual authentication process between the client and the server. SecureW2’s 802.1X authentication solution provides secure network access control, ensuring only authorized users can access the network – a crucial feature to complement mTLS to create end-to-end secure networks.

Mutual TLS, or mTLS, is a type of mutual authentication in which the two parties in a connection authenticate each other using the TLS protocol.

Mutual TLS ensures that both parties sharing information are who they claim to be by verifying that they both have the correct private key."

In July 2010, a South American security researcher who goes by the handle ""Ch Russo"" obtained sensitive user information from popular BitTorrent site The Pirate Bay. He gained access to the site's administrative control panel and exploited an SQL injection vulnerability that enabled him to collect user account information, including IP addresses, MD5 password hashes and records of which torrents individual users have uploaded.[27]

What is an SQLi? SQL injection is an attack used to manipulate the relational databases of a web application, such as MySQL, Oracle Database or

SQL injection, also known as SQLI, is a common attack vector that uses malicious SQL code for backend database manipulation to access information that was not intended to be displayed. An attacker wishing to execute SQL injection manipulates a standard SQL query to exploit non-validated input vulnerabilities in a database. The attack demonstrates that SQL injection is not just an attack that affects web applications or web services, but can also be used to compromise back-end systems and exfiltrate data. In addition, Imperva Database Security actively monitors data access activity to identify any data access behavior that is a risk or violates policy, regardless of whether it originates with a network SQL query, a compromised user account, or a malicious insider.

SQL injection (SQLi) is a web security vulnerability that allows an attacker to interfere with the queries that an application makes to its database. Most SQL injection vulnerabilities occur within the WHERE clause of a SELECT query. However, SQL injection vulnerabilities can occur at any location within the query, and within different query types. In cases where the application responds with the results of a SQL query, an attacker can use a SQL injection vulnerability to retrieve data from other tables within the database. However, you can perform SQL injection attacks using any controllable input that is processed as a SQL query by the application. The following code is vulnerable to SQL injection because the user input is concatenated directly into the query:

SQL Injection attacks (or SQLi) alter SQL queries, injecting malicious code by exploiting application vulnerabilities. The severe impact of these attacks makes it critical for developers to adopt practices that prevent SQL injection, such as parameterized queries, stored procedures, and rigorous input validation. However, if an application is not securely designed, it might allow a user to input SQL queries directly. A SQL Injection attack involves inserting or “injecting” a SQL query via the input data from the client to the application. Identification of vulnerable inputs: Attackers first identify inputs within the web application that are vulnerable to SQL injection. If the web application accepts these inputs without sanitizing them, an attacker can inject malicious SQL statements."

By securing IT infrastructures across companies and state lines, Duo’s two-factor authentication technology gives media companies the ability to validate users' identities whenever a login is attempted. Users can easily self-enroll in 2FA via an app on their devices, so no matter where in the world they travel or what technology they use, your information stays secure.

Two-factor authentication (2FA) is a security system that requires two distinct forms of identification in order to access something. 2FA does this by requiring two types of information from the user—a password or personal identification number (PIN), a code sent to the user's smartphone (called a message authentication code), or a fingerprint—before whatever is being secured can be accessed. Two-factor authentication (2FA) is a security system that requires two separate, distinct forms of identification in order to access something. Two-factor authentication is designed to prevent unauthorized users from gaining access to an account with nothing more than a stolen password. Despite the slight inconvenience of a longer log-in process, security experts recommend enabling 2FA wherever possible: email accounts, password managers, social media applications, cloud storage services, financial services, and more.
