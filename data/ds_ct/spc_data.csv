There are several options out there for password managers, which of course means that some will suit you better than others. Personal preference might come into play, but there are certain standard features you should consider before choosing your password manager. We’ll discuss ten of the most useful features of a password manager below.
Features of a Password Manager
1. Multi-Platform Support [...] There are many beneficial features of a password manager. Password managers not only store and input passwords for you, they can create those strong passwords and even protect other sensitive digital information. By securely storing your passwords in an encrypted password vault, these tools remove 99% of the memorization from the task of password hygiene. (You still have to remember your master password, but that’s much better than memorizing hundreds.) Most password managers also have features [...] Arguably one of the best features of a password manager: the secure password generator. Password generators make it easy to create strong, unique passwords that are practically impossible to crack. Since the password manager will be doing the hard work of remembering these passwords, you’re free to use all of the best practices for password creation so that they’re long, use mixtures of characters, and impossible to guess based on how much someone knows about the user. This is especially

We've outlined below five essential features that you need to look for when choosing a password manager. In our opinion, these key elements are the difference between a merely good service and a great platform.

1. End-to-end encryption



The most important feature to look for in password managers is advanced encryption. It is a must-have. Password managers are ultimately about data security, and without end-to-end encryption, your data simply won’t be adequately secure. [...] 3. Password sharing



Password sharing is an essential feature in an enterprise password management solution. Password sharing enables users to share passwords and credentials over secure channels and minimises the security risks associated with sending passwords over email, SMS, or messenger applications.

The best password managers will provide password sharing as an in-built feature, making it easy to share passwords and other relevant information from directly within the application. [...] Our final essential password management feature is one that is a must-have for businesses: role-based permissions.

If your password management account contains every one of your organisation's passwords, this can become a security risk in and of itself. The last thing you want is every one of your employees to have access to every one of your passwords.

All of the features you expect in a password manager are here, including auto-generating passwords, breach-monitoring, biometric login (for devices that support it), auto-filling passwords, and options to store other types of data, like credit cards and identification data. There’s also a password audit feature to highlight any weak or duplicate passwords in your vault. One extra I particularly like is the ability to tag passwords for easier searching. Enpass also makes setting up the syncing [...] Apps and extensions: Most password managers are full systems, rather than a single piece of software. They consist of apps or browser extensions for each of your devices (Windows, Mac, Android phones, iPhone, and tablets), which have tools to help you create secure passwords, safely store them, and evaluate the security of your existing passwords. All that information is then sent to a central server where your passwords are encrypted, stored, and shared between devices. [...] NordPass ($36 per year): Nordpass offers everything you need in a password manager. It uses a zero-knowledge setup in which all data is encrypted on your device before it’s uploaded to the company’s servers. Other nice features include support for two-factor authentication to sign in to your account and a built-in password generator (which has plenty of options to handle those poorly designed sites that put weird requirements on your password). There’s also a personal information storage

Some password managers offer extra features for additional security, such as automated device sync and access, multi-factor authentication, auto-fill passwords"

4. Biometric Security Features

Biometric security features have become a standard part of mobile security. They use unique physical or behavioral characteristics, such as fingerprints, facial recognition, or voice recognition, to authenticate users.

Biometric features offer a higher level of security compared to traditional passwords or pins. They are unique to each individual and can’t be easily replicated, making them a robust security measure. [...] Implementing mobile security in an enterprise setting requires a strategic approach. Here are a few important best practices:

Use Built-In Security Features on Devices

Most modern mobile devices come with built-in security features. These features include encryption, biometric authentication, secure boot, and more. [...] Using these built-in security features is a simple and effective way to enhance mobile security. However, these features are often not enabled by default, and users need to manually activate them. Solutions like MDM can help automatically enforce security features on user devices.

Secure Wi-Fi and Bluetooth

Wi-Fi and Bluetooth are common attack vectors for cybercriminals. Hence, it’s essential to secure them."
email security & nti-phishing software,"1. Spam Filtering: Automatically identifies and filters out unwanted or harmful emails.

3. Malware Protection: Scans attachments and links to detect and block malware and ransomware.
4. URL Protection: Examines links within emails for suspicious activity to prevent users from accessing harmful websites.
5. Threat Intelligence: Utilizes real-time data and analytics to stay updated on the latest email threats.
6. User Awareness Training: Provides educational resources and simulations to train users on recognizing email threats.
7. Data Loss Prevention (DLP): Prevents sensitive data from being transmitted via email by identifying and blocking such attempts.
8. Encryption: Ensures that email content and attachments are encrypted to protect against unauthorized access.","An email security solution that’s easy to deploy, monitor, and manage will help support and enforce a policy in a way that doesn’t overburden the IT department, email administrators, or messaging teams. Features such as the ability to handle all threats from a single interface and have employees manage their own quarantine list will help increase the efficiency of the solution and ultimately free up time for IT teams to spend on other projects.

5. Multi-factor Authentication: Adds an extra layer of security by requiring multiple forms of verification before granting access.
6. Compliance Support: Helps users meet regulatory requirements through built-in compliance features and documentation.
7. Redundancy: Ensures data is stored in multiple locations to prevent loss due to hardware failure.","The first of the main cloud storage benefits concerns usability and accessibility. Most of the cloud data storage services come with an easy-to-use user interface and provide a feature of drag and drop. For instance, you can think of Google Drive from Google or iDrive from Apple. They both have a simple interface, and you can easily upload your file on your online drive without any expert knowledge. For example, if you have saved a file in a drive using a mobile device, you can retrieve that [...] All cloud storage options provide file-sharing features, which help you to share your files with other users. You can either send a file to another user or invite multiple users to view your data. Mostly all the vendors provide a cloud environment in which two users using the same cloud service can share their data, though there are only a few service vendors that offer cross-platform file-sharing features.

5. Automation [...] Another benefit of cloud storage relates to synchronization. Each cloud storage provider gives the sync feature. With synchronization, you can sync the cloud storage data with any device you want. As we have discussed, we can access our data from any device and any part of the world, but this accessibility is done with the help of synchronization.

Cloud data storage is affordable and also helps to back up data without resorting to additional data centers, and data can be automatically replicated from

File syncing and storage services, also called cloud storage services, are a huge convenience. They let you get your data—Word docs, PDFs, spreadsheets, photos, etc.—wherever you are. And they create a backup of all your files by default. Some also let multiple people edit files at the same time. PCMag has been testing and reviewing cloud storage services for more than 15 years. We rate them based on ease of use, reliability, whether they work on all major platforms, extra features, and price. [...] What Can Cloud Storage Do for You?
The best cloud storage services integrate nicely with other apps and online tools, making the experience of viewing and editing files stored online feel natural. You want the other software you use to be able to retrieve or access your content, so it's a big deal to make sure you use a service that easily integrates with your existing tools. Box and Dropbox are particularly strong in this regard. [...] The range of capabilities of cloud-based storage services is wider than you may realize. Many of them specialize in a specific area. For example, Dropbox focuses on keeping a synced folder accessible everywhere and sharing folders with colleagues outside your company. Proton Drive emphasizes secure cloud storage. If you mostly store images, you might want a storage service that specializes in hosting photos (two top options are Google Photos with a Google One account and Adobe Lightroom). Some

Modern cloud storage data backup solutions offer innovative features that revolutionize data management and data storage. Advanced security, including encryption and two-factor authentication, shields data from cyber threats, while automated backups ensure essential data is never lost. [...] Moreover, the cloudâs scalability permits optimization of operational spending, eliminating the financial burden of maintaining on-premises data centers.

Cutting-Edge Features of Modern Cloud Storage Solutions [...] The beauty of cloud storage lies in its flexibility; users can scale their own data storage infrastructure as needs up or down and rely on the robust infrastructure of cloud storage providers that ensures redundancy and data protection through their public cloud storage service, making cloud storage work seamlessly for them.

In other words, physical disks you own will fail. Cloud services will keep the disks running for you.

Threat hunting. Threat hunters can use dark web monitoring to speed their hunting and develop a more comprehensive understanding of attackers and their methods.
Faster incident response. Investigation and response workflows can be used to mitigate threats as rapidly as possible. [...] In addition to scanning for data breach information, a dark web monitoring service can be used to classify risks from unknown sources. Businesses that receive alerts when their data appears on the dark web can connect those mentions to other threat sources, and use that information to profile and mitigate threats faster.
The types of risks that can be exposed through a dark web monitor include:

As explained above, dark web monitoring is included with ID protection plans priced under $10/month for an individual. These extra-affordable plans also include stolen funds insurance, expert case management and other benefits. The absolute best identity theft protection with dark web monitoring comes with slightly higher priced deals that include credit alerts and other additional features. Expect to spend about $20 month-to-month for individual coverage, or save per person with annual service [...] Credit/debit card information | Numbers, CVVs
IDs | Licenses, passports, etc.
Account logins | Emails and passwords
Medical records | Insurance, history, prescriptions
Certifications | Fake diplomas
Each plan below combines dark web monitoring with a wealth of other features. Comparing ID protection plans, you’ll see that some include $1,000,000 in stolen funds insurance with no deductible. The best plans also guarantee expert US-based help 24/7 in case your identity is stolen. [...] Basically, these services monitor common dark web marketplaces for any details related to your personal information. Any time they find a piece of your information, you get an alert of the leak which lets you take action before your information gets sold to someone who might actually use it.

What are the benefits of Dark Web Monitoring?

Reduced risk of data breaches: Proactive monitoring helps identify and address potential vulnerabilities before cybercriminals exploit them.

Enhanced brand reputation: Early detection and mitigation of threats can help protect the reputation and maintain customer trust.

Compliance: Helps organizations comply with various data protection regulations, such as GDPR, by providing timely breach notifications."

For example, next-gen hardware firewalls can block ports, inspect SSL traffic for malware or vulnerability exploits, perform website content filtering, act as VPN servers, and many other advanced features. More simple models, however, may only let you open a few ports. Software firewalls generally don't have these high-level features, with similar basic functionality of port [...] Hardware firewalls are standalone devices that secure entire networks. They are physical appliances, like a switch or router, that sit between the internet and your internal network. Typically, they will be connected directly to your ISP's equipment, so literally all the bits must go through them before hitting any other gear. They have a WAN port to connect to the ISP, and a LAN port to connect to your network. [...] They have the advantages of processing data through high-bandwidth links, centralized control for even the largest LANs, and simplified management. They can also protect hosted services, like applications, web, or email servers, with robust traffic monitoring and intrusion detection and prevention features.

The sandbox is a virtual operating environment for untrusted programs – ensuring viruses and other malicious software are completely isolated from the rest of your computer

The Comodo Firewall software remembers which software is allowed to operate and changes its alerts accordingly. [...] Firewall is network security software, programmed to prevent illegal access that travels in and out of a private network. It helps to manage the incoming and outgoing traffic of network that is based on a specific set of protocol. It examines each an every activity and blocks if it does not meet the required security norms. [...] Not at all! Our free firewall software has access to Comodo's safe-list of over two million known PC-friendly applications. When one of them accesses your PC, the firewall won't bother you because there's no reason to worry.

ZoneAlarm Free Firewall has earned recognition as the best firewall software from experts and millions of users worldwide due to its advanced security features, user-friendly interface, and reliable protection against online threats.

How does ZoneAlarm Free Firewall work?

A hardware firewall is a stand-alone physical device placed in the network to filter internet traffic. All computer network exchanges happen with data packets being checked with a firewall, enforcing security policies and access controls. Much like a server or a computer, the device is autonomous and dedicated to the sole function of connection inspection. [...] As a hardware firewall is self-contained, it has all the necessary hardware and computer software components to enforce network security boundaries. The exact features and mode of operation can heavily depend from one hardware firewall to the other, but it generally provides at least a URL filtering and intrusion prevention system (IPS).

How does a hardware firewall work? [...] For instance, hardware firewalls filter traffic from the uplink toward enterprise endpoint systems. That way, they insert themselves between the public internet and the organization's network. In contrast, firewall software analyzes traffic that has already passed through the uplink into the client but hasn't yet been accessed. This means that a software firewall allows threats much closer to the network."

Personal VPNs focus more on privacy, encryption, and usability on individual devices.

Let’s walk through the key features of each:

Business VPN features

Authentication and access control [...] The primary feature of a personal is hiding your device’s real IP address by assigning a different one from the VPN server. This helps obscure your location and makes online activity more difficult to trace.

Data encryption

Encryption is a core function of any VPN. It protects the data moving between your device and the VPN server, making it unreadable to third parties.

While all VPNs use encryption, the strength and type can vary depending on the provider and protocol.

Kill switch [...] Business VPN | Personal VPN

A VPN includes a range of features that help protect data and manage access.

A VPN service uses cryptography to protect your internet connection from unauthorized access. It can also act as a shut-down mechanism, terminating pre-selected programs in case of suspicious internet activity. This decreases the likelihood of data being compromised. These features allow companies to give remote access to authorized users over their business networks.

How does a VPN work? [...] The best VPN providers have minimal or no-logging policies to prevent data breaches from their end.

2. Updated software

The best VPN connections use the latest tunneling protocol. OpenVPN protocol provides more robust security than others. It is open-source software that is compatible with all major operating systems.

3. Bandwidth limit

All services have data usage limitations. You will need to choose a VPN provider that meets your data needs within budget.

4. VPN server locations

But there’s still one question many have about VPNs: How do you choose the right one? We created this guide to share all about VPNs, how they work, what features you should look for, how to fix common issues, and what our favorite VPN picks are.
What Are VPNs?
VPNs are affordable software that provides internet privacy. VPNs create an encrypted tunnel between your device and the worldwide web so that your internet activity is hidden from hackers, Internet Service Providers (ISPs), and others. [...] Encryption: Another essential feature of a VPN is encryption. We want all of our web traffic and our private IP addresses to be encrypted so that even if someone hacks into our VPN, they won’t actually be able to see any of our data. We look for VPNs with either OpenVPN or AES-256 encryption, the most secure methods available.

Virtual private network



Virtual private network (VPN) is a network architecture for virtually extending a private network (i.e. any computer network which is not the public Internet) across one or multiple other networks which are either untrusted (as they are not controlled by the entity aiming to implement the VPN) or need to be isolated (thus making the lower network invisible or not directly usable).[1] [...] Otherwise, commercial appliances with VPN features based on proprietary hardware/software platforms, usually support a consistent VPN protocol across their products but do not open up for customizations outside the use cases they intended to implement. This is often the case for appliances that rely on hardware acceleration of VPNs to provide higher throughput or support a larger amount of simultaneously connected users.

Security mechanisms [...] Applications that do implement tunneling or proxying features for themselves without making such features available as a network interface, are not to be considered VPN implementations but may achieve the same or similar end-user goal of exchanging private contents with a remote network.

What is a virtual private network (VPN)?

A virtual private network, or VPN, is an encrypted connection over the Internet from a device to a network. The encrypted connection helps ensure that sensitive data is safely transmitted. It prevents unauthorized people from eavesdropping on the traffic and allows the user to conduct work remotely. VPN technology is widely used in corporate environments.

2. Firewall Protection: Built-in firewall features help block malicious traffic and unauthorized access attempts.
3. VPN Support: Allows users to establish a secure VPN connection to protect data from interception and mask IP addresses.
4. Device Management: Offers control over connected devices, including limiting access and setting data usage caps.
5. Automatic Updates: Regular firmware updates ensure the latest security patches are applied, safeguarding against vulnerabilities.","If your phone hotspot or dongle doesn’t provide a good WiFi signal or meet your high-speed internet needs, you can opt for a mobile WiFi hotspot (portable hotspot router) instead. These are standalone devices specifically designed for connecting to mobile networks for WiFi device access. The best mobile hotspots, such as NETGEAR Nighthawk M6 and M6 Pro hotspots, have optimised antennas, long battery life, and additional features such as dedicated Ethernet ports for priority connections. [...] An obvious benefit of carrying a mobile hotspot router is that you don’t have to repeatedly add devices to the WiFi network. The devices are automatically connected to your WiFi hotspot instead, and then you only have to connect the single hotspot to a WiFi network for a clear signal. This system offers security for all your devices, and advanced mobile hotspots also have Ethernet ports, allowing you to turn wired internet connections into wireless ones. You can also use the built-in USB cable [...] Mobile hotspots are devices that connect to a mobile network. The latest 5G mobile hotspots are powerful devices with the capacity to perform multiple online tasks simultaneously. 4G LTE hotspots are also useful, but they don’t have the same level of networking capability. A mobile hotspot acts as a portable bridge for connecting your devices to a WiFi network. If you want a WiFi connection while you are out and about, a mobile hotspot is the solution.

What is mobile hotspot?

A mobile hotspot is a portable hardware device or software that serves as a wireless access point for connecting devices to the internet. It provides Wi-Fi routing capabilities similar to a home wireless router, except on a smaller scale. [...] When smartphones are used as mobile hotspots, they are sometimes referred to as cellphone hotspots or phone hotspots. Most modern smartphones support tethering, which means that they can share their internet connection with other devices. To use this feature, the phone must be connected to a cellular network, with the phone's tethering feature enabled. Also, the phone's cellular service plan must support tethering. This feature has become increasingly common in recent years, so it's rare to [...] Mobile hotspots can take the form of standalone devices, or other devices like smartphones, or laptops can use software to activate hotspot capabilities. Creating a mobile hotspot with a smartphone effectively turns the device into a router. Nearby devices such as laptops or tablets can interface with the mobile hotspot much as they do with other wireless routers. The mobile hotspot connects to the internet via a wireless cellular signal, rather than relying on a standard data signal.

Most people can rely on personal hotspots on their smartphones when they need to connect other devices to the internet, and most mobile phone plans offer a certain amount of hotspot data for this purpose. However,  separate mobile hotspot devices are great for business travelers. They create stronger and more secure networks, let you connect more devices at once, and last all day on a single charge. They also let you keep your personal and business data separate, and that’s a win! [...] A hotspot is a wireless access point that lets you connect phones, tablets, computers, and other devices to the internet when you’re on the go. Personal hotspots are built into most smartphones, but you can also get dedicated mobile hotspot devices that deliver faster speeds, connect more devices, and have a longer battery life than your phone. You can also find public Wi-Fi hotspots at many restaurants and public buildings. [...] T-Mobile takes the cake when it comes to 5G hotspots. The Inseego MiFi X PRO 5G is the ultimate hotspot device, with tons of features and powerful capabilities at an affordable price. On top of that, you can also get flexible and generous data plans from T-Mobile, with prices starting at $10 a month for 2GB and going up from there.

Verizon and AT&T both have great 5G hotspot contenders—the only catch is you have to pay more for most of the same features.

Pro tip:

When it comes to mobile hotspots, there’s a variety of models with different features. Normally, a hotspot will be created for a particular cellular service. Ultimately, the right hotspot for you will depend on your internet needs.

For example, you’ll likely want a hotspot that offers a blazing-fast 5G cellular connection if you plan to use it for competitive gaming, where split-second reactions can be the difference between winning and losing. [...] A mobile hotspot or hotspot device is like a personal, portable router you can use to connect to the internet with a compatible device when there are no public hotspots available. It uses a cellular signal to connect to the internet the same way your phone does, but you can’t use it to make or receive calls. [...] Mobile hotspots connect to the same 4G or 5G cellular networks that cellphones do. The mobile hotspot receives the cellular signal, converts it to a Wi-Fi signal and makes it available to any nearby device as long as the user has the SSID and password.

Ensure your hotspot supports 5GHz Wi-Fi, which is typically faster and less congested than 2.4GHz Wi-Fi. Our picks typically support both 5GHz and 2.4GHz. Some hotspots support guest networks and access controls, such as MAC filtering and time-based limits. Those features are on pretty much all dedicated routers nowadays, but you can't necessarily take them for granted on mobile hotspots."
