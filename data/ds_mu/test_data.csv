Playing treble and bass clef notes simultaneously on piano
I am new to reading music, so here is how I tried to learn: I set some landmarks on the piano (for example, G and C for the treble clef and F and C for the bass clef) and used the intervals between the notes to locate other notes on the piano. Then I tried to play some simple sheet music, and I was able to play notes for one hand (each of the treble and bass clef notes individually) using this approach.
However, I have a problem reading and playing notes on both clefs at the same time, specifically a note on the treble clef might go one interval up and another note on the bass clef might go two or three intervals down, which makes it hard for me to play. I tried reading the notes vertically as suggested in a YouTube video, but I still couldn't solve this problem. I'm wondering how to solve this problem. For what it is worth, I had this problem with the simplified version of ""Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star"" music:

(taken from the book: 129 (very) easy or intermediate pieces)


**Assistant:**
Get yourself an elementary [PRODUCT] and follow it. There'll be a well worked-out routine starting with single long notes in each hand separately, then together, then progressing to independent moving parts in both hands. The [PRODUCT] is reliable. Don't be put off by the illustrations - the process is the same no matter what age you start at! And don't gloss over the 'easier' exercises until you're sure you CAN play them accurately, without fumbling!"

Any way to automate checking of harmony rules?
I'm working through the book Harmony and Voice Leading by Schachter and Aldwell.  The book is great, especially as it has several exercises after each chapter which really help to ensure that you have learned the material.
My issue is though, that I have no quick way of checking my answers, e.g., where I have harmonized a melody.  I'm looking out for specific errors that the authors call out (e.g., chord construction errors like missing 3rds or voice leading errors like the 7th in V7 not resolving down by step).  I can if course check over my own work for these types of errors but this is time-consuming, and I also always have a nagging doubt that I may be missing something.  Is anyone aware of any tools or software which allow this type of harmony checking to be automated?  My own searches haven't turned anything up, but I find it hard to believe that such a tool doesn't exist.  I could write such a program myself, but of course don't want to spend the time if there is something freely available already.


**Assistant:**
There are many [PRODUCT] that do something like this to some extent. [PRODUCT] has a [PRODUCT] for this I remember.I personally did a [PRODUCT] [PRODUCT] for an extensible [PRODUCT] of rule checking. This one is based around a check interface:#(define* (make-check proc #:key (n-notes 2) (n-voices 2) (voice-contraints #f) (extra-args #f))(lambda (action)(cond ((equal? action 'n-notes) n-notes)((equal? action 'n-voices) n-voices)((equal? action 'voice-contraints) voice-contraints)((equal? action 'extra-args) extra-args)((equal? action 'proc) proc))))A check thus is a closure made up of a number of notes, a number of voices, optional filters for the voices and optional fixed voices. And a procedure, which is to be called with a frame of a given number of voices and neighboring notes. The framework would then try to evaluate simultaneous changes between notes between voices and call these checks with the given number of notes and for all combinations of voices.E.g. this% Do all voices move in the same direction? Takes 2 notes of all voices and checks% if direction of movement is the same for each voice.#(define all-same-direction-check(make-check(lambda (. voices)(and(or(reduce (lambda (x y) (and x y)) #t (map (lambda (v) (apply ly:pitch<? v)) voices))(reduce (lambda (x y) (and x y)) #t (map (lambda (v) (apply ly:pitch<?

Rules of thumb for when to strive for perfection vs. good enough in practice
I’m trying to come up with good rules of thumb for when it is beneficial to strive for perfection in instrument practice vs. when doing so has diminishing returns and one should stop at “good enough” and move on.
On the one hand, I imagine that routinely stopping at good enough is essentially training yourself to play sloppily, and on the other hand, obsessing over a single thing may lead to burnout or injury, and sometimes leaving a difficult piece or exercise and returning to it later after building some “supporting skills” can help overcome a challenge.
So, concretely, for each of the following types of activities, where would you draw the line?

Preparing a repertoire piece for a show
Learning a new piece (slightly above one’s level, not for a show)
Sight reading (slightly below one’s level, for fluent reading)
Daily reading practice (“a piece a day” kind of thing, for extending one’s vocabulary)
Technique (scales, arpeggios, rhythm, other technical exercises)
Other activities I forgot?

I usually have a mix of these activities I work on at any given time and I struggle with the urge to perfect everything.
Thanks!


**Assistant:**
I work as a professional pianist and keyboardist for a music theater department. I have learned and performed something like 2000 songs in the last three years (according to my forscore) and many of them have been virtuoso, difficult pieces for world class venues. What I can tell you is, when you are actually working, perfectionism is profoundly harmful. I strive simply to be consistently correct. Here is my little algorithm, which presupposes some technique.How to learn musicAttempt to play the whole piece, either by ear, or from the score. If the piece is so hard that you don't even know what is going on, it is too hard for you. Pick an easier piece, get a teacher, or, if you were hired to play it, get a sub immediately.Once you have read through the piece and decided that it is possible within the available timeframe, read through it again. A good deal of issues will solve themselves. Fake everything else as if you were onstage in Carnegie Hall.Now, go back and figure out what the greatest technical challenges are. This is a good time to do an analysis of the piece. I highly recommend just writing down observations on some legal paper or a text document think a list like this:The A section begins on measure 5 after a brief intro that is composed of the orchestra part from the from the first phrase of the A sectionThe A section is composed of a dramatic opening motif, followed by a series of suspensions.There is a difficult technical section in the B theme that repeats over and over again, and which I got wrong.Pick a part to work on that maximizes exposure. This means, if there is a difficult accompaniment pattern that happens 150 times and will sound dumb if you can't play it, start with that before tacking a weird fingering that happens once.Find a technical solution to your problem very slowly. This can mean a change of fingering, a change of embouchure, anything it needs to be to make sure you can play it correctly.Once you have solved your technical problem, ingrain one small passage pertaining to it with the following techniqueUsing a [PRODUCT], find a tempo at which you can play it correctly with minimal effort.Repeat the passage correctly 5 times in a row at this tempo. If you mess something up, start your count over. If you mess up the same thing several times, select a smaller section, reduce complexity of the section (only playing one of the hands), or reduce the tempo.Once you have found a comfortable tempo, and repeated it five times correctly at this tempo, decrease the tempo in increments of 5 clicks on a standard [PRODUCT] until you hit the bottom of the [PRODUCT]. (40 bpm is fine on digital [PRODUCT].) Attempt to play it exactly correctly with all articulations, fingerings, and in exactly correct time at each of these slower tempos. This is more difficult than it sounds and will expose a lot of fakery that worked at the comfortable tempo. Repeat step 2 as new issues pop up.Once you can play the passage comfortably, correctly, and reliably at the lowest setting on your [PRODUCT], return to your previous comfortable setting, and play it again. Correct any mistakes with step 2.Increase your tempo by 5 clicks (or 10-15 bpm), and check it at all of these higher tempos on your [PRODUCT]. Once you have found the upper limit of your playing, go back down five clicks and slowly increase the tempo in increments of 2-4bpm or 1 click. Once you find your upper limit again, stop. Move on. You have done what you can with this passage, and you should be exhausted from the concentration.Make sure that you can incorporate this passage into a larger passage, by attempting a few measures on either side.Do this a couple of times for a couple of important passages, and then take a significant break. You shouldn't practice for more than 2 hours at a time, but you also shouldn't practice less than an hour or two a day if you want to make progress.Keep track of what parts of the process are working the best, and which part are not. If you are having a hard time playing fast, consider exercises. or fast repertoire. If you can't read through a piece all the way through with fakery, start practicing your sight-reading more by setting a [PRODUCT] to a new piece and getting through it by staying in time no matter what you have to botch or leave out.Return to whatever you have been working on the next day, and see what has improved, and what has not. You should approach it with the attitude of a scientist, with a dispassionate interest and no ego attached to outcome.This process effectively balances correctness and practicality for me. Tweak it constantly as you see fit. I certainly do!"

Understanding notation for Organ Registration
I try to rearrange the organ part of Maurice Duruflé's own orchestral reduction of his Requiem (ca. mid 20th century), but I struggle to understand some specifics of his organ notations (see screen shots below):

What do ""R"", ""G"", ""G.R."", sometimes ""m.g."" mean?
At one location it says ""G. _4"" that might be a registration?

Regarding organ registration: Any tip where I can practice / listen to the different sounds, it says for example: Flute, Bourdon, Principal, Gambe, Voix celeste, Cromorne, Fonds et Anches, Mixtures, etc. since I can't imagine the sound when arranging for my instrument (accordion)?
Perhaps there is a ""organ for dummies"" website somewhere?
Thanks in advance, Dostl_ba


Introit Page 1:


Introit Page 5:


Kyrie Page 5:




I add this to my own question (after coming back to my arrengement)
There is a nice organ glossary in german and french wikipedia, perhaps someone wants to translate this to the english wikipedia:
https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orgel-Glossar


**Assistant:**
Some of these indicate [PRODUCT] divisions, each corresponding to a manual in the [PRODUCT] console. G is ""grand [PRODUCT]"" (in English, ""great"") and R is ""récit"" (in English, ""swell"") -- a set of pipes enclosed in a box with louvers that control the volume by their opening and closing. G.R. indicates that the récit should be coupled to the grand, so the organist will play on the grand manual, and pipes from both divisions will sound.The vertical brackets show which notes each indication concerns.M.g. is not a registration instruction. It stands for ""main gauche,"" which means ""left hand.""Ped _ flûtes 8 means (assuming the underscore is actually a minus sign) ""Pedal, remove flute stops, 8 foot."" (Flue pipes are basically fipple flutes, similar to a recorder; each stop's octave is indicated by the length, nominally, of the C2 pipe; 8 feet is notated pitch; 16 ft is an octave lower; 4 ft is an octave higher, etc.) Similarly, R + Fonds 8 means ""récit, add 8 foot flue stops."" Péd G. R. means ""couple the great and swell to the pedal."" ""G. _4"" would mean ""turn off the 4-foot stops on tbe grand [PRODUCT].""Anches (English: ""reeds"") have metallic tongues that vibrate in the air stream, similar to a harmonica or indeed an accordion. Mixtures are groups of pipes tuned to harmonics of the nominal pitch, so for example the A2 key might open a pipe sounding at 550 Hz and another at 660 Hz. Bourdon pipes are stopped flue pipes: they sound an octave lower than they would if open, and they have only odd harmonics. So R. Fonds et Anches 8-4, Mixtures means ""récit, flue and reed stops, 8 and 4 feet, with mixtures,"" and _G. Fonds 8-4, Bourdon 16"" means ""grand [PRODUCT], flue stops, 8 and 4 feet and bourdon 16 feet.""What does this all mean, though? First, I notice that you didn't highlight the registration given at the beginning of the introit. Obviously this is important! Without it, an instruction such as ""remove the 8-foot flutes"" makes little sense. More generally, you can start by recognizing the significance of the octave indications (16, 8, 4, etc.), and that that anches indicates a richer, more complex tone with more upper harmonics, and mixtures even more so. Obviously all of the stops on an accordion are reed stops, but you would want to use the least reedy ones for the flue stops and lusher combinations for e.g. rehearsal 16 of the Kyrie. Adding stops not only changes the sound quality, of course, but also the volume. And at the opening of the introit, where the left hand is playing the swell (marked piano, so presumably closed) and the right hand plays the great coupled to the swell, the right-hand part will be significantly louder than the left-hand part.Duruflé made two other versions of this piece, one for full orchestra and one for reduced orchestra with [PRODUCT], so these orchestrations can also be a good source of inspiration for your own registration.As to learning the sounds of individual [PRODUCT] stops, keep in mind that they varied somewhat over the centuries. Probably the best thing to do would be to befriend an organist or otherwise arrange some practice time on an actual [PRODUCT]. Failing that, listen to as many different recordings as you can by famous organists of this piece and any other for which you can find the score, and listen for the differences in their registration choices.Finally, as with any transcription or indeed any performance, the spirit of the law is more important than the letter. Don't play a crescendo before rehearsal 16 because Duruflé wrote cresc ... molto cresc. Don't add a 16-foot stop at 16 because Duruflé said to. Instead, ask yourself why Duruflé gave these instructions and how you can realize the music most effectively. The crescendo has a purpose; adding the 16-foot stop has a purpose. Yes, you should start by adding the lower octave at that point on your accordion if it is feasible, but if it sounds too muddy or does not support the formal inflection point of the bass entrance for some reason, you should explore other options."

G string becomes out of tune in F shape barre chords
So I have been playing an acoustic guitar for quite some time and after buying my first electric guitar I've noticed a strange thing. Everything seems to be in tune and regulated, except one thing. When I try to play some F shape barre chords, the G string becomes a bit out of tune. It sharpens, to be exact. It is actually noticeable, especially at the first three frets. Whenever I try to play the F chord, for example, the G string sounds like a slightly sharpened A. However, it doesn't affect other chords that also involve the G string. I can play the A shape barre chords across the fretboard without any problems, at least right now. Maybe I just unintentionally bend the string somehow? Any advice/suggestion appreciated!


**Assistant:**
Since you say you checked the intonation already I think the culprit is one of two things:Your nut slot may not be cut low enough on the G string causing the first few fretted notes to be sharp because of the string bending as you push it down. This sharpness will diminish as you go higher up the neck since the string will not be bent as much as you go up the fingerboard.What to do: Test the individual notes on the G string with a [PRODUCT] from open to maybe fret 5 and see if frets 1,2,3 are sharper than the open string and the notes on the higher frets. If they are your nut slot is too high on the G string.If the individual notes on the G string play in tune then you are likely pulling down with your 2nd finger when you play your chord (which is actually an F chord with an E shape, not an F shape like you mentioned) and bending the string slightly.What to do: look at your fretting hand in a mirror and see if you are pressing straight down or if you are pulling towards the ground with that finger. The G string should appear completely straight and not bent by your 2nd finger."

Guitar triplet legato: should i lift all fingers while moving to the next string?
I see many legato practices didn't mention about it.
Each time i play 3 notes in one string, i tend to lift all 3 fingers and pick the next string first note (2 left fingers are on the air).
I notice that this way make the previous notes lose their sustain, then i try to keep these two fingers on the first string until i pick the first note on second string then use hammer on on the rest (like spider walk practice)
It sounds more smooth, but i'm not sure is this the good practice for legato since it slows the movement down?
Edit: To have more clarity, i play 3 notes on the low E string, then ascending 3 fingers on the A string. Pick the first note, two remains on the E string while the first move to the A string and pick (this is spider walk and sounds smooth to me.
If i lift all fingers from the E string before picking the first note on A string, it sounds not smooth (not spider walk)
Here are the photos of the moment changing string from E to A:
Lift all fingers

Spider walk



**Assistant:**
Legato means ""tied together"", maintaining a smoothly connected unbroken sound, so your idea about keeping the previous string's note sounding as long as possible, spider walk style, is right. It will require focused practicing, but if you're not focusing, it's not practicing to begin with.You may find that your movements slow down, but as always you practice with a [PRODUCT], which keeps things in control. Start practicing with a slower tempo and gradually speed it up, constantly paying attention to good timing as well as the intended legato sound. It takes time, but your technique will improve, when you keep practicing.Edit. Maybe I misunderstood your question. Reading the question and Tim's comment once more, I'm not 100% sure what exactly you're doing with the fingers that aren't fretting the sounding note. But things like that aren't easily communicated on a forum like this anyway. Hammer-ons (ascending) and pull-offs (descending) instead of picking are a way to achieve a legato sound. And you shouldn't lift your fingers unnecessarily high away from the fretboard anyway, and you shouldn't have to apply unnecessary pressure either, with fingers which aren't really doing any fretting. Touching strings with fingers is a good habit, because it helps in controlling when the strings are allowed to vibrate.Concentrate on good timing, good sound and good relaxed hand and finger motions. When in doubt, consult an actual teacher."

How do you recognize open-position chords by ear?
So, in my ear training class, we're seeing open-position triads. Major, minor, and diminished in all inversions.
I can't for the life of me identify these chords by ear. I just hear a random string of dissonant intervals and can't make out the fundamental pitch or the inversion.
Does anybody have any tips for identifying these chords? Our teacher unfortunately hasn't said much, he has shared no method to resolve this.
Any advice would be appreciated!


**Assistant:**
Based on my personal experience: learn to play by ear, and then the identification question becomes ""what would I have to play to reproduce the sound I'm hearing."" Is it a minor or major chord, what's the bass note and what's the highest note. Stuff you'll learn when you play full songs by ear.This can be split to three areas. First you learn to play major/minor/diminished chords by ear, regarless of open/close voicing. For this you'll preferably need practice material that's guaranteed to include only basic triad chords in root position, not sevenths etc. and no inversions.Then you learn to play bass inversions by ear. For this you expand your practice material to something that uses bass inversions.Then you learn to play the highest note by ear like it's in your example material.These are skills, not knowledge. It's not something you ""know"", it's something you can do, and it comes through lots of practicing.To improve learning efficiency, you could try to accompany songs by ear, or play in a band. By ear. It should provide an incentive to get it right? Ok, maybe not for everyone. But you'll have to put yourself in a position where it matters if you get it right. There have to be positive and negative consequences to you. Basic learning motivation.Edit: for practicing playing chords by ear you should naturally use a [PRODUCT], preferably [PRODUCT]. Tim's answer provides good advice about playing the notes arpeggiated slowly, as well as simultaneously. Adding notes to the sounding chord one by one strengthens your feel for the role of each individual note in the chord. Singing particularly the highest note as ""melody"" may improve your sense of hearing the highest note. In [PRODUCT] and organ accompaniment, the song's lead melody is often doubled with the highest note of each chord. With guitar, this is rarely done, because it requires using a lot of different fingering shapes and changing positions along the fretboard to suit the melody. Which is quite an advanced skill for guitar accompanists."

Is it possible to record direct from an amp to Audacity?
Recording my bass amp's output via an external microphone results in subpar sound quality. Is it possible to record direct to my computer (I use Audacity for recording audio) from my amp?


**Assistant:**
Yes, you could record directly to a computer provided it has a line input (a mic input won't work). This input will likely be on an 1/8"" jack, which will require an adapter to accommodate an amp's 1/4"" line output. Getting levels set properly, without prominent background noise or distortion, could be a challenge. 1/8"" connectors are also quite fragile. Catch your foot on the cable just once, and you could easily destroy the input jack.Why hassle with it? Just buy an [PRODUCT]. Keep it simple: buy a [PRODUCT] with two input channels (even one would do it) . Connect your bass amp's line output (1/4"" or XLR) to the [PRODUCT]. Set your levels. Record away. Even a cheap [PRODUCT] should give you excellent sound quality.For example: https://www.sweetwater.com/store/detail/ScarSG3--focusrite-scarlett-solo-3rd-gen-[PRODUCT]Some [PRODUCT] (like the Scarlett above) have an instrument input, which changes the input impedance to better match an electric guitar or bass. You could then plug directly into the [PRODUCT] if you want the pure, direct sound of the instrument. Monitoring becomes a bit trickier with this setup, as you'll now have latency (delay) to deal with.In short: unless you've already blown your music toy budget, there's no reason to record directly into your computer."

How to connect headphone output to a ""balanced"" monitor speaker?
It seems complicated to connect a digital piano's headphone output to a monitor speaker which takes a ""balanced"" input.  How is it done?
It seems what a ""balanced input"" is, is to use 3 wires to send a signal, so that no matter how long the cable is (such as 25 feet), the noise can be canceled out. Some info here, here, and here.
So then, if we get one of these speakers, such as the Yamaha HS5 or HS8, then how do we connect a digital piano's headphone output to it?  There are TRS to XLR cables that connect Tip and Ring together... but will it work? (because if one signal is subtracted from another, then it becomes 0).  If we use the ""pure"" TRS to TRS or TRS to XLR cables, is it true that it won't work?  Or do we need a mixer to do that, because if we do, it may seem like the easiest way is to use a regular computer speaker pair.  Also, the cable I use is merely 5 foot long, so it is not like it really needs a ""balanced"" connection. One possible way a cable can work is, if the ring is totally disconnected, then when the ""balanced"" signal is obtained, the positive is subtracted from the negative (which is always 0), and we still get the positive signal to output to the speaker. (but so far I have not seen such cable being sold on Amazon). If we connect Tip and Ring, then they subtract to become 0 and should not work. (Amazon does sell cables that connect Tip and Ring together).
The question is, what if we want to connect the digital piano's headphone output to a studio monitor like the Yamaha HS5 with balanced input, how is it done? (and is it a good choice to do that?)


**Assistant:**
Yamaha HS5 has both balanced and unbalanced input, you can simply use the latter.If you're looking for other devices, some of them have a ""combo"" inputs, which may seem like XLR at first, but in fact allow also to connect an unbalanced 1/4"" jack. Check your device spec sheet.I agree, piano headphone or line output should be quite strong and should work fine with an unbalanced connection. Give it a try. The worst thing I can think of are ground loops which may add some noise.As you wrote with a properly made cable you can connect an unbalanced output to a balanced input, but the connection will be still unbalanced. It might be good enough for you.For a truly balanced connection you indeed need to convert the signal. You could use a [PRODUCT], as you proposed, but a more typical tool for the job is a [PRODUCT]."

Are these indentations on the frets of my Acoustic for intonation? Can I apply this to the frets of my Electric?
The questions are in the title, picture is below, but here are the (TL/DR) details.
About 9 months ago, I bought an electric guitar ""kit"" and assembled it (fun, highly recommended). This included fret leveling, crowning, and polishing. A guitarist friend of mine acted like I might as well go over Einstein's Theory of Relativity and see if I could find some mistakes—it's that difficult! But it went well, in my opinion.
I got the intonation pretty close at the 12th fret through normal saddle adjustment, but ran out of travel on the 2nd and 3rd strings, and had to reverse the individual saddles to get them spot-on. The only problem I still have is the intonation on the first few frets, not so much on strings 4-6, but it's pretty bad on G(3rd), somewhat bad on B(2nd) and merely noticeable on E(1st). They sound sharp, bad on the 1st fret, better as you go up until about the 5th fret is again spot-on. Google tells me that this is pretty common (though I have no explanation as to why G is an especially fickle string!).
I've come to appreciate that if you squeeze the crap out of (example) the G string on second fret that this causes A to become really sharp, and if you just barely touch the fret, it's not so bad, but even when I'm barely touching the fret, which is not gonna happen in normal play, it's still almost 25 cents sharp.
Some of the advice on the internet tells me to flatten the entire string slightly so that the G is slightly flat and the A is only slightly sharp, but, like, I mean, what the hell???? Other advice I've seen is that I'm probably being too critical; nobody else will hear the difference. Trouble is, I don't believe it. Barre chords sound fine, and when I'm playing at or above 5th fret, even perfect. In this case, every string is fretted, and any slight sharpness due to squeezing the string against the fret is equal across the board, probably unnoticeable.  But, when playing open chords (especially, for instance, ""D"", as 1st - 3rd strings all are fretted at 2nd or 3rd fret, yet 4th string is open), it sounds bad. Even open chord ""E"" has a big problem of the G string fretted at 1st fret (worst string, worst fret, followed by two open strings).
I've been considering trying to shape the individual frets under 3rd string frets 1-3 slightly back (toward the nut), but this seems really scary (worse than the Einstein thing!), especially seeing as how I'm pretty close now.
THEN!
(cue dramatic orchestra hit)
I was changing the strings on my Ibanez Acoustic I've had for about a year and a half. While cleaning the fretboard, the light caught the frets in such a way that I could see slight dents(?) under the 1st, 2nd and 3rd strings. Heaviest (dark red circles) on the 1st fret and getting lighter on higher frets until they seemed to completely dissapear on the 6th fret (green circles):

(click to enlarge)
The flash obscured the similar dents under the 3rd string, but they're there.
Now the wheels are turning again: Are those indentations there on purpose for intonation? Can I apply this same technique to my electric, relatively* easily? Any other thoughts/methods I could try to help this?
Or is it more likely that I am completely, irreversibly insane?
* thanks, Einstein!


**Assistant:**
That's fret wear. The strings have slowly eroded away some of the fret material, leaving those dents. Over a long enough time, they become deep enough to cause problems.When the fret wear is bad enough, you can have your frets ""leveled"", which means sanding down the tops of the frets so that the dents are sanded out. Then the frets a re-crowned and dressed and polished and they will be good for a while. Eventually frets wear enough that they have to be replaced, which is called a ""refret"".All guitars have compromises on intonation - it's a consequence of the construction and mechanics of the guitar. One thing you can investigate is a [PRODUCT], which is a nut which has tiny extensions so that the nut side of the strings has intonation adjustments made kind of like the saddle side of an adjustable saddle bridge.Another factor in the intonation of guitars is the ideal placement of the frets, adjustment of the saddles, and the overall action.Personally, I do like your friend suggested and I deliberately tune the open strings of my guitars slightly off from where the tuner would have me tune them in order to make a tradeoff for better intonation around the 7th - 9th frets, where I like to play the most. I don't do this on my acoustic guitars, but I do it on my electrics.Another thing I agree with is that mainly listeners don't notice the intonation quirks of guitars, but in some ways they do but it doesn't matter because that's a part of how guitars sound. It's one of the little details that synths and sample libraries don't quite get right when they try to imitate guitars."
