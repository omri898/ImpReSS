What are these slanted surfaces on the bridge saddles of my electric guitar?
I randomly took a closer look at the bridge of my electric guitar and noticed that the brass saddles have some weird, flat, slanted surfaces where the strings run over them.
Interestingly, these surfaces are facing in the opposite direction, so not every string runs over them in the same way - some lie flat on the surface, others run right across the sharp edge. Also, the middle saddle is a completely different part (meaning you can't rotate it to look like the other two). Nothing of this seems random, and I suppose it must have a clear purpose of some kind. Anybody knows what it could be?




**Assistant:**
Since the saddles are in three pairs like an old Telecaster bridge it looks like the different angles are there so the lower [PRODUCT] will automatically have a longer [PRODUCT] length. However, like you said, the middle pair is backwards, the D [PRODUCT] is shorter than the G. This is intentional. As @ojs said in comments if you use a wound D and an unwound G this would probably work but if you use heavier [PRODUCT] with a wound G this will give you problems so try to stick with unwound G [PRODUCT]. You probably will have to compromise when intonating each pair. Individual saddles are much better for accurate intonation.This bridge looks like it was designed to improve intonation of the old Tele bridge while still maintaining the three double saddles the original has. The fact that one [PRODUCT] goes over the curved part and the other goes over the straight part has no real bearing, the important thing is the location of the high point where the [PRODUCT] crosses."

How to listen to my guitar on earphones on a live playing gig while it also sounds in the main monitor speakers, and switch off the guitar sometimes?
I am playing with a DJ and the music is getting each time better. I'm jazzing her music with my Line 6 PODxt Live pedal and my Dean Fly-V with Seymour humbuckers doing awesome sustain and quality. The thing is that in some places the music is a little away from us to get 100% details of my audio and before some songs I need to adjust my effect before starting to play with the music she is playing.
How can I connect my earphones to my guitar in order I can switch the output to her Pioneer DJ mixer whenever I want? So I can adjust on the go, before making it sound on the main sound monitors, I mean.


**Assistant:**
John's solution was my first thought. But you may have your hands full of guitar at those moments. So augmenting the equipment needed with a couple of simple [PRODUCT] placed in the signal train would alleviate that problem."

Basic principles of piano fingering for simple right hand melody
I play various instruments already but am teaching myself piano. I want to play simple melodies like the one shown below. It seems a general principle regarding fingering is to allocate one finger to each note in a scale over a 5 note span, and then to pivot using the thumb. However it is not always clear where to pivot, and it also seems that the occasional deviation from such a strict pattern may well increase playability considerably.
I'm wondering if someone could give me some pointers on which fingers to use for the right hand melody in the piece below, along with a description of the general principles from which the specific fingering is derived?



**Assistant:**
Let's consider three ""positions"" which are very common...I made up the three labels ""5 finger"", ""full octave scale"", and ""full octave chord"", but something like those labels is used in many [PRODUCT].Now apply those to a passage with some position changes starting at bar 2 beat 2...Or it could be done like this...The slur lines are not meant to be actual performance phrases, but are meant only to show groupings of notes into one of the three position types.Notice that the F#4 marked with * is common between two positions, an incomplete run of 5 finger on E, which ends on finger 2, and the beginning of a full octave chord on D. That finger 2 is the place where you ""pivot"" between two positions.Also notice the G4 to F#4 marked with **. This is the other place where you ""pivot"" into a different position. Especially notice how the first G4 is played with finger 1, but after the pivot into a new position, the G4 is played again, but with finger 3.You can think of some of these position changes as ""contracting"" or ""expanding"" beyond a given position. For example, at the first change * you can think of the move from F#4 finger 2 ""expanding"" or ""extending"" the end of a 5 finger on E down a step to reach the D to start a full octave chord position.The change at ** can be seen as a ""contracting"" of the full octave scale on D where normally the Gf to F#4 would be played with fingers 1 and 3, but because we a pivoting to a 5 finger on E the F#4 is then played by finger 2. It's like the bottom part of the full octave scale on D is ""contracted"" up into the E position.Expanding and contracting positions like that happens all the time. But also some position changes are accomplished switching fingers on a repeated note, or silently changing fingers on a held note.A lot of [PRODUCT] are based on playing 5 finger position, scales, arpeggios, repeated notes, and double note scales (like playing scales in thirds in one hand.) When you practice those kinds of patterns in all major and minor keys, and apply the patterns to simple harmonic patterns like I V I, you eventually start to make position changes without too much thought.My suggestion is get a good [PRODUCT] to practice you scales, arpeggios, etc. while working on actual pieces like the jig. If drills seem boring, first be selective about the [PRODUCT] you choose. Some are more creative than others. Also, make your own variation on practice drills. Keep drill time at a level that suites you. Don't do zero drilling, you will miss out on a lot of fundamental skill development. Don't do to much that it kills your enthusiasm. Think of it as support for playing the real music."

Trouble keeping tempo while marching
I am doing marching band for the first time for a small parade in my town. I am having trouble keeping tempo while marching. I stand right behind the percussion and while they are playing cadence I have trouble marching with everyone else. Does anybody have any tips to help me stay in step with everybody else?


**Assistant:**
In working on rhythm, and especially beat, the [PRODUCT] is your friend. Do practice with it regularly. You're particularly lucky that all the songs are at 120; you can just focus on internalizing that exact bpm.I imagine much of the difficulty is with how the rhythms interact with the beat. Even in your own part, to march on the beat and play any rhythm other than solid quarter notes is its own ""rub your stomach, pat your head"" challenge. If you play 8th notes, you're tempted to move your feet in 8th notes too. Practice your playing with the [PRODUCT], so you can hear where the beats fall within the rhythm and get used to the distinction. Practice simply marching at 120. Practice simpler rhythm patterns while marching—maybe a measure of quarter notes, then a measure of 8th notes, etc. Rhythms that explicitly subvert or conflict with the beat, like syncopation, can be even more challenging. Try to first get your feet moving ""on autopilot,"" then keep them going without much conscious effort while you focus on the rhythms of your part. This is a learned skill, and you will get better at it the more you practice it.Meanwhile, the percussionists behind you are ""clouding"" the beat even more. Marching band percussion parts are often intricate and complex, with a lot of syncopation and multi-beat tuplets. I realize how funny this sounds, but try to ignore them. Focus on something that can provide you with the simple beat. Surely you can see the feet of the people around you? Try to simply follow them.Ideally it would be great if you could get used to the percussion parts enough to ""find"" the beat in them. I realize it might be challenging in the average ""BabadababadababadaBUMBUMbadaBUM"" marching band percussion section, but if you can play along with a recording you can at least get used to playing over it.This is a problem common to marching bands, and maybe someone privy to that culture can give better advice than I can as a violinist. I know bands regularly practice together with a [PRODUCT] blasting over a PA."

Why does my midi device have a long delay (cool-down period) between consecutive key presses?
When pressing a key on my midi device and monitoring it in Midi-OX, it takes a long time (about 5 seconds) before it registers another input. Note that I'm nót talking about the delay between pressing a key and midi-OX registering it, but the delay between it registers another key after pressing one. A ""cool-down period"" so to speak before it recognizes another input.
I have used both Cubase and Midi-OX as software to monitor, and both have the same problem and ""cool-down"" period of around 5 seconds. I have tried both a PSR550 keyboard and a Yamaha Clavinova piano - again same result on both.
I use a Logilink UA0037N Adapter USB to Midi (In-Out, 1,9 m) to connect the keyboard/elec piano to my Medion Erazer laptop.
What could be the problem?
EDIT:
As suggested I bought another cable: M-Audio USB Uno MIDI Interface 1 in/out. About twice as expensive (€30) and the best I could get. There is still the same delay. This cable does seem to be more sensitive for touch-sensitivity and pedals etc., but as soon as I press a key it will not react to another press (or release) for ~4 seconds.
The plot thickens though - anything other than the black-white keys on the Clavinova/PSR work perfectly fine. The pedals, buttons and pith-bender all work real-time.
Even stranger still - after any input óther than a key, the ""cooldown"" will reset and it will react to another key-press or release, at which point it stops reacting to any more key presses again.
So I've used different devices (PSR/Clavinova) different cables, different software (Cubase and Midi-OX) and different computers (tested everything with an old laptop as well that had usb2 instead of usb3 ports). I also looked in the PSR manual to set it to ""midi output mode"", which is apparently a specific mode for the keyboard when using it as a midi device. All setups and combinations have the exact same problem.
EDIT2:
Turns out it WAS the cable. I just took my entire setup to a place that had dozens of different cables lying around, and eventually one worked normally. It seemed to be completely random which ones worked and which didn't though; some really cheap cables worked and some high-end brand ones didn't (though cheaper cables had the problem way more often). I really hate midi now.


**Assistant:**
5 seconds is beyond anything reasonable in normal operation. So we have to search for something outside of normal operation. What is common between your experiments? Obviously your computer. Then we haveI have tried both a PSR550 keyboard and a Yamaha Clavinova pianowhich does not look like a commonality until we realise that a PSR550 is also from Yamaha. That makes it likely that both devices share the same kind of [PRODUCT] and basic implementation.Another commonality obviously is your [PRODUCT]. Looking for images of this device, it appears to be a branded copy of the standard cause for Midi problems, an [PRODUCT] with a mixture of violin and bass clef on one side.This [PRODUCT] is known to garble Sysex messages and it is known to garble running status bytes which are used (among other things) for compressing note-off events into shorter Midi sequences by broadcasting them as note-on events with velocity 0.This is the reason this garbage [PRODUCT] tends to fall apart under polyphony when a keyboard utilises this sort of compression for sending notes in tight sequence.My guess would be that either the keyboard or the [PRODUCT] changes use or interpretation of running status bytes when a longer delay to the last byte has been interposed. It may well be that 5 seconds after the last note, the next note from the Yamaha keyboards will be sent without using running status byte compression (even though it would still be applicable) in order to avoid missing notes when someone replugs Midi connectors (which presumably tends to take at least 5 seconds, or at least people will not expect it to work immediately in case they are faster).Either that, or the [PRODUCT] has a timeout period after it got confused where it reverts to a sensible behavior.It would appear that the Yamaha keyboards make the cheap [PRODUCT] fall apart more conspicuously with even simpler use than what commonly makes it drop out. I would not blame the keyboard, really.There are actually good brands for [PRODUCT] (like Roland, Yamaha, M-Audio) and lots of vintage USB1.1 [PRODUCT] from those brands which are plenty fast enough at 12Mbps for most purposes (depending on the hub, you might want to avoid sharing a hub with a mouse or keyboard or other slow device). Get one of those preowned and forget about the cheap ubuquitous standard Chinese junk with the fantasy clef on it."

Is it possible to get a mandolin style tremolo on an acoustic guitar?
Somewhat inspired by my other question about the pipa
I believe the Mandolin's unique sound comes from the tremolo made possible by double coursing. Is it possible in principle to get a similar sound from a single coursed acoustic guitar (i.e., 6 string not 12 string)?
I suspect the answer might yes but it is much much harder.


**Assistant:**
The mandolin's two string coursing means you get the sound of unisons in a single ""note"", but also it also means the plucking of the pick on each string is slightly offset in time. You can use tremolo picking across two guitar strings to get the time offset with the picking, and to some extent you can get unisons.If you use the G and B strings on guitar, you can play unisons and tremolo picking the two strings will get a bit of the two string course sound similar to mandolin. If your guitar has a cut away you will be able to get up to the higher frets, where they are closer together, making the unisons less of a stretch, easier to play.I think other two string combinations can give a similar effect. Playing in thirds on strings G & B or sixth on strings B & E with tremolo picking is nice and reminds me of mandolin.Playing the high E string open as a drone while playing some melody on the B string, again tremolo picking, sort of has a mandolin effect.The picking is tricky. To me it seems you must keep the pick at the exact level of the strings, don't dig in deep it catches the pick, slowing you down, and making the tremolo uneven. Moving from the elbow, not the wrist, seem to help.One other idea. While not necessarily about tremolo, I have always felt that the guitar with a [PRODUCT] up high, maybe around the the seventh fret and higher, makes an acoustic guitar sound a lot like a mandolin."

What is the proper name of the ""layered"" sequencer in Roland Fantom series?
Complete beginner here.
I saw a demo of Roland Phantom-0x and usage of its sequencer (?) -- a person played for example some drums on a keyboard (I am not talking about numpad), it was recorded by Fantom. Then it was played back and the person played for example piano as separate layer. If player made a mistake, the recording could be deleted. Then both tracks (drums+piano) could be played back, and on top of this could be added layer of guitar. And so forth, layer by layer, single person could recreate entire piece like a full band (minus the voice). What's more, layers length could be different -- for example layer K could be very short, so it was possible to loop it.
I searched in the music store for phrase ""sequencer"" and then searched on YT to view some demos, but either I was out of luck, or the demos were more focused on numpad of the sequencer and providing drum beat from it.
So is it ""just"" sequencer in Fantom series, or is it separate category -- ""layered"" sequencer? (I am looking for proper name of course).
I am interested in hardware device, not program for computer. I have an old Yamaha keyboard which has MIDI in+out connections so I though that maybe I could buy such layered sequencer, connect it and at moderate price have more fun. Assuming that if I play violin on my keyboard sequencer is able to store the info about the instrument and then played it back correctly.


**Assistant:**
It is simply a [PRODUCT] (pretty much all [PRODUCT] are multi track). What you call layers are more typically called tracks, say drum, bass, piano, etc. tracks. Sometimes they have a limited number of tracks that you can record, say 16 or they might have many more. There are some standalone [PRODUCT] available today. Some of them combine internal sounds such as drums with sequencing and some are combination [PRODUCT] and samplers. They were very popular when MIDI first came out and before digital audio recording became available. Now MIDI recording is more commonly done with computers, software (many are free) and a [PRODUCT] to a computer. Some things to keep in mind are price point and the ability of your keyboard to play multiple sounds at once (multitimbral). If you have a computer you can get a [PRODUCT], or [PRODUCT] (some are free, like Apple’s [PRODUCT]) and an inexpensive [PRODUCT] and it may actually be cheaper than an actual [PRODUCT]."

Can I have a 24"" / 60cm C string on a Harp?
We just got a new lever harp.  It starts at F, around 24"" long.
After I tune it, I'd like to be able to play each note in increasing order, to validate the tuning.  But F Major requires B flat, which is a note I can not generate unless I tune all the B strings to B flat (so that the lever will take it to B).
As we're going to replace the strings it came with with better ones, if I'm going to change things, now is the time.  So:

Should I just tune all B strings to B flat?
Can I just start at C instead
Am I just completely confused?



**Assistant:**
My daughter recently started learning harp. The teacher told us to tune it by engaging (putting ""up"") the levers for all E, A, and B pitches, and then tuning the result to C major. Or another way of thinking of this is, with all the levers disengaged (down), the harp is in E flat major.I guess the reasoning behind this is to let you play in the keys that have only a few sharps or flats without retuning anything: You can play in up to three flats simply by disengaging the levers that you had engaged (for E, A, and B), and you can play in up to four sharps by engaging the others (F, C, G, D). You would have to re-tune some strings to play in keys like A flat major or B major, but without retuning you can play in 8 of the most common keys. (Plus more, really; she's playing a piece in C harmonic minor right now, so she still doesn't actually need the B flat that's in the key signature.) This video explains it well:By the way, I strongly recommend using a [PRODUCT] to keep your tuning accurate; you need more than ""playing the notes in order"" to ""validate"" it. Be aware that:The strings will stretch, so you will need to correct the tuning frequently at first, but less so as they adjust to the correct tension, andAs you tune, the adjustments you make can affect the pitches of other strings, even ones you've already tuned. Especially at first, I follow a strategy like:Tune the middle C and all Cs above it, then all Cs below itrepeat with Esrepeat with GsSo I've just tuned ""in an arpeggio,"" leaving gaps. Now I check the strings I tuned at first, like the Cs, and correct if needed; otherwise I move on to ""fill in the gaps"" with D, F, A, and so on.Oh by the way, if you plan to replace all the strings, I strongly recommend that you don't do it all at once. I mean, for one thing, literally don't take all the strings off and then start putting them on; it might be bad for the instrument to remove all the tension at once (it certainly would be for a violin). Plus, it might be hard to remember what goes where. But also, as I said, new strings stretch, and it could be nice to give them all a chance to do some of the worst stretching one at a time. I might replace them in a pattern similar to how I described tuning, starting in the middle range. If the harp is playable right now, I might take my time, replacing one or two strings per day. (Or, then again, I might get impatient for the day when they've all settled in, and get it over with a bit faster.)Also, be aware that when you buy a harp ""string,"" you often get a length of gut that will allow you to get at least two ""strings"" (two sounding lengths) out of it by cutting it in half. This is good, since they inevitably break, and you want to have those backups! Finally, note how the knots are tied in the ends of the existing strings. The lower notes probably have the knot tied around a short length of spare string, used as a sort of crosspiece to help keep the knot in place."
