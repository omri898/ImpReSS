Guitar Intonation - Flat On Certain Frets
I was practicing bends last night by doing the ""check with a tuner how accurate you are bending"" method. I noticed something about my intonation on certain frets:
At open and 12th fret, the intonation looks good. The tuner registers pretty much the same thing across all strings...
But if I fret anywhere between 6 and 10, the tuner is reading flat. This seems to be across all strings, but is worst around fret 10 on the g and b strings, where the tuner was reading about 8 cents flat vs the readings on open and 12th fret.
Below the 6th fret, things seem to go back within the range of normal tuner error. I didn't test above twelfth but will check again tomorrow.
First thing that came to mind is the fret spacing is off. Is this ""normal""? What might fix it? It's a cheap guitar (entry level Pacifica built in 98), so anything expensive probably isn't going to be worth it, but would be interested in ballpark.
Could it also be the truss rod needs adjusting?
Many thanks for your time.


**Assistant:**
Fist of all it is totally normal for intonation on guitars to be off. With the old bound gut frets you could bend the fret to intonate better, with straight metal frets there is no chance.There is a possibility that the frets are off. Fret spacing requires very careful measuring and cutting to be correct. Also an incorrectly placed [PRODUCT] can mess things up. But even if it is correct intonation will still not be great.The problem here is: Pressing the [PRODUCT] down changes the tension, and that affects intonation. On a theoretically perfectly spaced fretboart intonation will thus be too high. One solution to this would be to slightly offset the [PRODUCT], moving frets up and thus lowering fretted notes. But this does not change all notes equally. The effect this has on notes is stronger, the higher at the neck you are. But the effect of tension also depends on things like action and initial [PRODUCT] tension. But assuming it was even then in fact only the open [PRODUCT] is off, and thus the actually better solution is to move the [PRODUCT] down a bit, which will not affect any fretted positions.The other problem is that in fact vibration speeds depends on amplitude (so when plucking the pitch is higher and then goes down). Now, since lower positions also have more amplitude the [PRODUCT] will necessary be out of tune.Next we have that [PRODUCT] (for similar reasons) do not have a harmonic spectrum. [PRODUCT] have overtones that go sharp, and this inharmonicity increases with thickness and decreases with length and tension. This inharmonicity causes the pitch to be perceived sharper than the fundamental (and this is something a simple tuner does not account for, which is why a piano sounds out of tune if you tune it by a tuner). This can be offset to some extent by offsetting the [PRODUCT].Obviously this means that you‘d need to set the frets for a particular setup and even then there will be a difference across [PRODUCT].But generally:The higher your action is, the more effect this will have on intonation. Especially make sure you haven’t got too high [PRODUCT]/neck/saddle action. A good setup can also improve intonation.[PRODUCT] tension will affect intonation. You can experiment with different [PRODUCT].Using a properly [PRODUCT] and [PRODUCT] can improve intonationBut even then you will never get a perfect intonation on guitar."

What would happen if you take a 12 string acoustic and tune it down to drop c tuning?
That is to say drop D but all the string down a whole-tone? What would the sonic possibilities be with a 12 string guitar tuned in drop c tuning? Could there be some music to be made on such an instrument? I'm interested in experimenting with really low drop tunings on acoustic instruments.


**Assistant:**
When you tune any guitar lower, without changing anything else,The instrument sounds a lower pitch (of course).The [PRODUCT] have less tension. That's how you tune an instrument, by changing the [PRODUCT] tension. Lower tension [PRODUCT] will be more sensitive to pitch changes from stretching and bending. They will vibrate with a wider [PRODUCT] excursion when strummed at the same intensity. That means fret buzz starts happening at a lower dynamic level.For an acoustic instrument, it will probably lose a small amount of volume, since lower frequencies require a larger instrument body to project. There is also less energy in the looser vibrating [PRODUCT].The neck bows back slightly, because there is less [PRODUCT] tension. This also effectively lowers the action of the instrument, which also means fret buzz starts happening at a lower dynamic level. You may want to loosen your truss rod if you are keeping this lower tuning. Or even better, you may want to change the [PRODUCT] to a [PRODUCT] first, if you are keeping this lower tuning.There is no danger of catastrophic failure from tuning down. Try the tuning and see if you like it.You can still make music with it. You don't need [PRODUCT] at all to make music. You don't even need a guitar. But you will have to judge if this tuning is helpful for the type of music you want to make. Drop tunings are very common because they are very useful for making many popular styles of music.The sonic possibilities are going to be everything that drop D can do, but 1 whole step lower."

What is the TYPE of software called that allows you to compose and synthesize music?
So, I don't know the first thing about music.... but that doesn't mean I don't want to mess around and see what I can come up with. I've always wanted to try and compose something digitally, on a PC.
I imagine a program where I could add tracks, choose an instrument for each track, and then mark what notes to play when and how long. Plus maybe add some special effects on top of that.
I think that Fruity Loops FL Studio might be something like that, however I'm not sure. It's also pretty expensive for just some lightweight messing around. These days however you can find anything for free in the Open Source world - if you know what to look for.
Unfortunately, so far I've had no luck. All the tools that I've found have been just sound editors aka DAWs, like Audacity - you can import or record whole tracks and then start messing around with them - but nothing about composing. The best I could do is to maybe find some free online library of samples and then painstakingly insert and position every sample manually, to line up. Not what I had in mind at all.
So that makes me think that I just don't know what to search for. What do you call a (type of) software that allows you to easily compose songs and listen to (a synthesized version of) them?
(Note: I'm not asking to recommend a specific software. I want to know what to search for.)


**Assistant:**
For you, does 'compose' imply notation? As you lead with 'I don't know the first thing about music' I suspect not!There are two main categories of program. A [PRODUCT] ([PRODUCT]) and a [PRODUCT]. The [PRODUCT] focuses on audio production, the [PRODUCT] focuses on producing a publication-quality score. But the better [PRODUCT] feature a Score Edit page where you can work with notation, and [PRODUCT] have playback! At the top of the range, there is considerable overlap. Sibelius, though primarily a [PRODUCT], can be hooked up to quite advanced sample sets for playback. And Cubase, a [PRODUCT], now has a Score Edit page derived from Dorico, the same company's flagship [PRODUCT].But you want free. The free [PRODUCT] is [PRODUCT]. For a [PRODUCT], [PRODUCT] is now free for PC users. Mac has [PRODUCT]. There are others.A [PRODUCT] also lets you 'draw' notes on a time grid. Sort of notation, but in a very visually representative way."

Which instrument lies just below the trumpet in register and has a timbre most similar to it?
My music editor muted the notes for trumpet because they’re too low for the instrument. However, during my first try, before saving the file, it did play those notes, and they actually sounded quite nice. I’d like to keep that sound, but to do so, I need to substitute the trumpet with an instrument that can handle those lower notes while still having a timbre similar to the trumpet. So, what instrument do you think that would be?


**Assistant:**
I'm guessing that this question isn't about scoring for live musicians so much as about persuading a scoring program to play back 'out of range' notes.Do you have a choice of playback devices/sample sets? Some are pedantic about playing notes that aren't available on a 'real' instrument, others are happy to play out of range, even if the sound is less than authentic. The fact that you did once manage to hear the notes suggests that you have something available that will play them. An old-school General MIDI soundset will do it. A theoretically more accurate sample set may not.But, if you want a trumpet-substitute for notes below written F#, the obvious, generally-available choice is simply a [PRODUCT]. And that applies whether we’re talking about computer playback or a live orchestra/band.Incidentally, [PRODUCT] allows you to adjust where a note is coloured red to indicate out-of-range. But this doesn't affect whether it will attempt to play it. That's baked in to the instrument. For instance, this note plays, despite the red colour warning!And actually sounds pretty good. Perhaps that's your answer - work in [PRODUCT]. That note isn't available in the 'better' sampled trumpet provided by e.g. Sibelius Sounds. Though NotePerformer takes a (rather less satisfactory) shot at it. It seems the 'better' the soundset, the worse it copes with extreme range demands!"

How to prevent an electronic sustain pedal from squeaking?
I am the proud owner of a Wegrower DP-10 sustain pedal.  It is cheap but it does its job.  Lately it's begun to squeak when released.  Can anyone tell me how to fix it?  If I took it apart, where might I apply lubricant, and what kind?


**Assistant:**
Talc powder, [PRODUCT] (for wood-wood contact, applied eg., with [PRODUCT]), or [PRODUCT] (esp. with all metal/plastic parts) (eg., [PRODUCT]) can do the trick.We use [PRODUCT] for mechanical pianos (wood touching wood). You can take a [PRODUCT] and draw-fill-stroke gently the surfaces to process, then blow some air to remove the excess. You can do the same with [PRODUCT].[PRODUCT] [1,2] are silicium based instead of carbon based and are rather colorless. Ideally, if you got the right one, you apply one drop, it spreads over the surface and stays ""forever"", no further maintenance needed.[PRODUCT] is a mixture of [PRODUCT] ([PRODUCT]). I do not recommend this: it will be dripping, smelly, staining, attracting dust, etc. It's rather for metal-metal contacts, cleaning, degripping. Unlike the right [PRODUCT], it will go away, and it will also likely melt plastic parts or make them more fragile, breakable or bendable."

In orchestral writing, how did (Baroque) composers think about two parts almost doubling one another but not quite?
Here is an excerpt from Bach's first movement of Matthäuspassion. Note how the choral bass almost doubles the continuo, except for some small ornaments which are very much thematic; then it goes to diverge for a bar, then goes to 8ves and unisons.
It's almost as if the continuo is the Schenkerian middleground to the choral bass's foreground.
I'm currently transcribing this piece for organ; I've put the continuo in the pedals, but I'm constantly running into dilemmas about including the choral bass or not and how much.
How did people back then think about this kind of almost-doubling? What rules and guidelines did they teach and/or follow? I've a background of university-level music theory, part-writing, and orchestration, where we covered doublings and rules like no parallel 8ves, but not this in-between thing.
Theory, historical views, guidelines, and advice all very much appreciated!




**Assistant:**
Baroque musicians were practical people, adapting or re-arranging music for different venues, instruments, singers quite frequently (both of Bach's passions, as well as Händel's Messiah, are known to have had this kind of treatment - and it is usually possible to reconstruct the different versions). This practicality is the key to the answer here for the differences between different bass parts, and has little to do with Schenker or any modern theories.In cases like the above, I think its possible to group the ""changes"" in three large categories:Adaptations due to range:Instruments do not all have the same range, even if they are roughly in the same register. Singers, notably, are not very comfortable singing very low, nor very audible doing so: big bass instruments like the violone (double bass) and the pipe organ (when played not as one too often sees today on a small positive, but on the big church organ, as would have been done at the time) however add quite a lot to the music when doing so. You see this all the time in chorales, where the bass voice stays one octave higher while the continuo jumps down for a few notes, the two usually recombining when appropriate. In your example, this is exactly what's happening in the second system, mes. 2-3.One will also frequently see this in the organ part: the lowest note one sees on organs is usually the C just below the bass clef. Considering that, in Leipzig at least, it was tuned one whole tone higher than the instruments (the part, when the manuscript part has survived to the present day, is almost always transposed one tone lower), this inevitably leads to frequent cases where a low c or c-sharp (resp. b-flat and b required on the organ) in the continuo is just not available on the organ: the whole line or fragment thereof is then moved up an octave to suit the range of the instrument.Simplifications due to different instrumental capabilities/functions: Beyond the mere question of range, not everything will sound great on every instrument, particularly in the bass register: for ex., the larger pipes on an organ need some time to 'speak' properly. In addition, the role of the continuo as the harmonic foundation of the whole piece would be very much weakened if the line were disturbed every few notes with ornaments (difficult to get exactly right between multiple players when rehearsal time is limited, as it was back then) and passing figures. This is why you will often see the vocal bass line (sung by the capable singers which Bach had at his disposition) simplified in the instrumental continuo, at least in large movements with orchestra and choir. This happens throughout your example, but I'm going to provide another one, in this case not of a bass line but an instrumental obligato in a soprano aria, to show how the ""same"" melody can be adapted to best suit the capabilities of a given instrument: (BWV 84, 3rd mvt., ""Ich esse mit Freuden, mein weniges Brot"")The soprano - not quite a violin... - sings sensibly the same thing as the oboe once the singer enters at the end of the instrumental ritornello.3) Genuine ""polyphony"": This is rare, to the point exemples are difficult to find, but there are indeed a very few cases where the bass (and or lowest sung voice, a common practice particularly in motets, there are many such ""motet-like"" movements in Bach's oratorios and cantatas) is mostly doubled by the instruments, except for a few measures where one can recognise a distinct melodic line. This however usually has the effect of reinforcing the continuo by giving it a line which more clearly affirms the tonality and any harmony in the moment. For ex., in the central mvt. of BWV 4, Es war ein wunderlicher Krieg, mes. 30ff.:One sees that most of the changes are for the sake of clearer bass motion (ex. the tonics of dominant-tonic-like harmonies, or the emphasis on the tonic-leading tone motion in mes. 34) the differentiated line is only present when the sung alto is not (thus preserving a four-part counterpoint), and that this doesn't last for very long.One final aspect I haven't mentioned is words! The sung text is fundamental to vocal music of this period, and several ""changes"" between voices and instruments can also be interpreted at least partially from this perspective, whether it be succesive bass notes which are prolonged because the instrument doesn't need to articulate a new syllable, or octave jumps which tend to not be unrelated to tonic stress (ex., in the given chorus, KLA - gen, TÖCH - ter, &c).I don't have the time to look at it right now but in terms of [PRODUCT] I'm sure [PRODUCT] would be a good place to start."

Changes to make to improve feet/pedal playing
Sometimes it feels like I can't keep up with my feet/pedal playing...what changes can I make to improve?
Do I need to stretch and/or strengthen my ankle?
Do I need a better throne? (I'm tall and use a cushion on top)
Is it better to play with my heel off the ground? (I struggle to stay balanced and end up shifting my weight in rhythm as I play)
UPDATE
Kinda embarrassing to admit, but you don't know what you don't know.
I experimented playing with the pedal under my knee...I had been playing with my heel in front of my knee and sitting on the front of the thrown. Moving the pedal closer and sitting back and on top of the throne means I can now play heel-up much easier.
Amazing what a small adjustment can make! ...thanks again to everyone that shared their thoughts


**Assistant:**
Heel down means you're far more balanced on the [PRODUCT] - and doing likewise with the hi-hat makes you feel even more stable. It's partly a personal choice, partly the style of music being played. A lot of players use both, according to what needs playing.If your [PRODUCT] is so low that your knee is above your hip, that will not be optimum, and will slow you down, whichever method you use. Also an unsteady [PRODUCT] will make you tend towards heel down. Maybe a [PRODUCT] could help?Where your foot actually sits (stands!) on the pedal will make a difference as well, as sometimes you won't need to let it return to its rest position, but keep it short, so the stroke is shorter.How you press the pedal will also have some bearing on speed. It's not always a downwards movement, as in stamping on it, either with your toes or the ball of your foot. You could try sliding your foot forward, given the time, which will also make the pedal hit the kick drum, but with a different motion.Above all, experiment with all sorts of differences - kick directly in front of you; slightly to the side (just like the hi-hat, but less so), changing the [PRODUCT] height a fair bit, changing footwear, etc., etc.And, as is so oft said, play everything slower than you can, using a [PRODUCT], to attain military precision, before trying to reach warp speed!"

ABC: one word under multiple notes

z D D D|
w: Lorem ipsum|


How can I achieve that the word ipsum will be centered under the last two notes when I do not want to use hyphen (ip-sum)?


**Assistant:**
ABC is a text based notation standard, not a [PRODUCT]. ABC is not intended to be a format to be rendered to a graphical score, but actually an alternative to graphical scores. This means that to get from ABC to a graphical score you’ll need a piece of [PRODUCT] to translate the information content. But as ABC does by design not require a lot of the information relevant to graphical scores the amount of control you’ll have over the output is quite limited.Now, what you are looking for is called a melisma. In ABC notation you notate a melisma using *, so you can do:z D D D |w: Lorem ipsum * |But note that while the official ABC specification states that * is a skipped note in lyrics it does not in any way impose how this is supposed to look in graphical output (as ABC does not care about graphical output). This means that the [PRODUCT] you use might understand that on such a melisma the next note can be placed closer to the first than the lyrics allow. But that depends on the capabilities of the used [PRODUCT].If you use [PRODUCT] for example the * will turn into _, which will by [PRODUCT] be correctly interpreted:[PRODUCT] on the other hand will produce:So the output will really depend on the [PRODUCT]. Instead of * you can also use _, which should produce a line:which is probably better than nothing. But really as ABC is a notation to represent music, not musical notation you cannot expect to get full amount of control over the rendering. If you want to actually produce graphical scores and do want to have that control over the rendering you should probably use something else, such es [PRODUCT] or a [PRODUCT] (but it is important to know that not all [PRODUCT] supports this feature. In e.g. MuseScore you can do melismas with an extension line totally fine, but you cannot really to it without a line, unless you leave a space and manually drag the syllable in the position you want).EDIT: Also note that for the sake of not needing a hyphen sophisticated [PRODUCT] will actually not print the hyphen if by doing that the syllables can be placed closer together. So using an adequate [PRODUCT] the [PRODUCT] should be able to decide quite well if placing a hyphen makes sense in some place or if it doesn’t. E.g. this in [PRODUCT]{r8 d'8 d'8 d'8} \addlyrics {Lorem ip -- sum}will be rendered aswhile this{d'1 d' d'} \addlyrics {Lorem ip -- sum}will employ a dash:"

Should I use wax or polish cleaners on a high-gloss white piano to protect its finish?
Does a polished white piano need regular maintenance (such as those wax or polish cleaning products that exist in the market) to keep its wood and color in good condition? I've heard that waxing can protect a piano's finish, but others say it's not really necessary for white pianos and can even cause buildup that's hard to remove. Now I’m confused — should I take any specific steps to protect my white piano, or is simply dusting it with a microfiber cloth from time to time enough?


**Assistant:**
A white piano will (just like a black piano) be varnished using a quite thick layer of polyester or polyurethane varnish. This varnish should not interact with a lot of chemicals, and waxing it will simply smear on it. If it needs cleaning it can easily be cleaned using a wet cloth, but then you should usually not get the piano dirty in the first place. Mostly you should care to not scratch the varnish or hit it with hard objects, and to not expose it to heavily to UV light (which can eventually make the varnish brittle). There is no real maintenance you can do to keep the varnish in good condition, and nothing you put onto the varnish should go through it. Except maybe that it is a good idea to clean off sweat and gunk, although even there modern varnish is quite strong.And quite frankly, you probably should not do such maintenance. Putting random stuff on musical instruments is often not a good idea (although many guitarists disagree). This is especially true on old pianos that mostly have shellac polish finishes. And the maintenance that the piano actually needs will be taken care of by your piano technician when the piano is tuned. Just make sure to not damage the varnish or the instrument and you’ll be fine.And this means: Be careful around the piano to not scratch or dent the varnish. Try to avoid getting it dirty, and if it does get dirty, clean it carefully. Make sure the piano is not in a room that is excessively dry or humid (in case it is it might make sense to invest in a [PRODUCT]). And never put random stuff on the instrument, especially on the wooden parts that are not varnished!Generally the outside of the piano is just a beautiful case. The wood that really matters is the wood on the inside."

No.In addition to the 31.25 kilobaud rate, the MIDI protocol requires 5V signal level and 5V reference voltage (EDIT: Later revision to spec allows 3.3V for both). Audio outputs typically don't output DC at all, AC components can't be adjusted to a specific voltage and for headphones the maximum voltage is somewhere around 1V.[PRODUCT] and [PRODUCT] don't cost much.

Wiring hot leads from two pickups to single pot
I am wishing to wire up my telecaster so that the tone control acts as a ""blend"" or ""fade"" knob (whatever you want to call it).
I have done a lot of reading and not only were the early telecasters like this, but many people wire the second tone on a Strat to do the same thing: if in bridge position, bridge pickup on full and tone blends/fades the signal from the neck pickup. Opposite for being in the third position where you have the neck on full and bridge is the one that's being blended in.
My question is, I have two ways I've seen this wired:

the hot lead from each pickup being extended from where it meets the switch, one attached to one outside lug of the pot, and one to the middle lug.
have the hot from where the neck pickup is connected to the switch extended to one of the outside lugs of the pot, and extending the signal from the switch to the volume, then to the inside lug of the blend pot.

My experience is limited as is my understanding of how all this works. I'll upload a simple diagram of both options. I would love if someone could explain if either will work, and how it would work.
Again my apologies if I'm asking too much.




**Assistant:**
I followed the switch schematic from the video you linked:Position 1 Position 2 Position 3,-A1 A1 A1| B1-. B1-.

The [PRODUCT] does nothing.Position 3 gives neck pickup, with the [PRODUCT] allowing to add the bridge pickup in parallel.Both in positions 1 and 3, the [PRODUCT] controls the amount of blend the same way, so in one extreme setting all 3 positions would sound the same, and in the other extreme setting there would be (almost) no blending.Note, the [PRODUCT] in the diagram is [PRODUCT]. Again, I can't remember which way the [PRODUCT] turns, but depending on which pair of terminals on the [PRODUCT] you use (you need to use the middle, and one of the side ones), the blending will be more or less smooth.Method 2 is similar, with one exception:Position 3 gives only neck pickup. The [PRODUCT] does nothing.You could add blending, by connecting the A3 terminal to the third (unconnected) terminal of the [PRODUCT]. This would make blending work in the opposite way for positions 1 and 3, i.e. [PRODUCT] setting for maximum blending in position 1 would correspond to no blending in position 3, and the other way round. You probably would prefer a [PRODUCT] rather than [PRODUCT].Edit: Below I'm attaching diagrams of the electrical circuits, for both methods in all 3 position of the switches. Please note in Method 1 Position 3 and Method 2 Position 1 some of the paths cross without connection. In Method 2 Position 3 I also added in yellow possible extra connection that would allow blending."

Laptop causes noise to effects pedal when hooked up via USB
I use a BOSS SY-300 on my guitar pedalboard (don't laugh; it's very versatile), but when I hook up the USB to my laptop to use the editing software, I get a big increase in noise from the SY-300 to my headphones (it also happens with my amp).

If I unplug the [PRODUCT], the noise disappears.You have a ground loop and/or noisy [PRODUCT]. Essentially, the [PRODUCT] is adding noise to the ground plane of the [PRODUCT] which is connected to the ground plane of the USB connection which is connected to the audio ground in the SY-300.

Is it possible/recommended to paint the side of piano's keys?
I see that many pianos' keys are kept unpainted. Is there a reason for that? Can it cause any issues to paint the side of piano's keys? (the natural wood that can be seen on the attached picture)



**Assistant:**
It's certainly possible. Whether it's a good idea depends on your goals. This answer assumes that the primary goal is to maintain the piano in optimum playing condition, in which case it is not a good idea:the [PRODUCT] will change the weight of the keys, which will change the balance, touch, and playability of the instrument, which is designed for unpainted keys.there is very little clearance between the keys, so there is a good chance that the [PRODUCT] will cause the keys to bind to one another, which will make the instrument essentially unplayable.In a comment, you mention that the purpose of doing this is to alter the appearance of the keys. Depending on your budget, there are some options that would have a somewhat lower risk than [PRODUCT].The best option, of course, if you are prepared to spend a lot of money, is to approach a piano manufacturer with a custom order. Their engineers and designers might be able to accommodate you. This approach might also be possible if you are a prominent artist. See for example the Chihuly Olympia a Steinway with unconventionally colored keys (at least on their exposed surfaces -- peach naturals and yellow sharps).If a custom order is not possible, and you are willing to accept some risk, the options would depend on the color you seek. A [PRODUCT] or [PRODUCT] would be preferable to [PRODUCT] as it would add less mass and less width to the keys. If you want a dark color, you might consider some sort of [PRODUCT].Other things to consider as ways of reducing the risk include experimenting on a damaged instrument that isn't worth repairing and consulting a professional technician for advice."

How can I simplify or accelerate my learning of sheet music?
I've only been at the piano (or rather a 61-key keyboard) for about a month now. However, just out of curiosity, I wanted to ask what skills one must require to read and play using sheet music fluently. Is there any simpler way of reading it? how can I learn sheet music?


**Assistant:**
Here are the things most helpful to me when I was learning to read — not in any particular order:Remember that the goal is to read music, not notes.Read from extremely simple pieces. ""Simple"" means that you can read the pitches, the rhythm, the articulation, the dynamics, both hands all at once the first time. After one time through, but not more than three, you should be able to have a good feel for the music. Even the simplest exercise can be made musical, if only to a small degree.Learn to recognize intervals at sight and feel them in your hand, with appropriate fingering. Most any beginning [PRODUCT] will have exercises to this effect. The one I'm most familiar with is [PRODUCT], which I recommend unreservedly.Learn to clap rhythms while keeping the beat, independently of reading the pitches. For example, tap the beat with one foot while clapping the rhythm. There are many [PRODUCT] for studying rhythm. I recommend [PRODUCT]. (There is at least one other [PRODUCT] by the same title, but different author.)Once these basics are sufficiently ingrained, Then the next steps involve recognizing groups and patters of notes, especially scales and chords.

Guitar amplifier placement for live band
For several years, I have played guitar in a rock band. Our band leader insists on putting our amps in front of us. He says if the amps are behind us, it will cause feedback with the vocal mics going into the PA. (Yamaha StagePAs 600). We are mostly playing in smaller clubs with no dedicated sound tech or sound board. Our amps are plenty loud enough and we do not mic anything besides vocals.
However, putting our amps in front of us means I cannot hear what I--or anyone else--is playing. It also blasts the audience with our guitars because the amps are sitting right at the front of the stage.
I want to place our amps behind us (backline), but the band lead says that the only reason that every other band on the face of the planet puts their amps behind them is because they are mic'ing up their amps and turning the amps way down so they do not cause PA feedback.
What is the general or best practice for amp placement in a live setting?


**Assistant:**
Your band leader is astonishingly wrong.If you’re playing places small enough that only vocals are miked, then your best option is to use [PRODUCT] that are [PRODUCT] with no more than about 50 watts of power (if they are [PRODUCT]), and they should be mounted behind you on [PRODUCT] angled up to point at your ears. Meaning each player’s [PRODUCT] points at that player's ears. The dispersion cone and sound coming from the sides and back of the [PRODUCT] will be good enough for other band members to hear unless you’re on a bigger stage.The bass player only needs 100-300 watts (solid state) and a [PRODUCT] is probably the sweet spot there. That can simply be elevated on a [PRODUCT].Having the [PRODUCT] flat on the ground is not at all ideal because the audience will get way too much [PRODUCT] sound and the players won’t get enough. Having them in front of you is frankly just silly.The way I know what I’m talking about is I’ve been taught live sound by a seasoned professional and worked part time as a live sound engineer for several years, and I’ve been a guitarist for over thirty years including many bar gigs. In both roles I’ve gotten compliments on both overall sound quality and stage volume. Even when you have a PA with monitors, my placement recommendations are still ideal, especially for guitarists who would like to play with feedback.Here's an example from one of my former bands. I'm on the far side of the stage and you can see my [PRODUCT] by looking directly past the bass player. It's a dark grey/black [PRODUCT] mounted on a [PRODUCT] angled up at my ears. The bass player has a fairly obvious [PRODUCT] with a tweeter behind them. We played this venue many time and the PA was decent, with two front-of-house speakers and two floor monitors, both for vocals only. Our [PRODUCT] were clearly audible for all of us in the band and for the audience.We received many compliments on our sound from random audience members, bar tenders and bar owners, and members of other bands. Bands who played this tiny bar with [PRODUCT] on the floor with [PRODUCT] on top generated a lot of rolled eyes and secretive complaints."

Having problem with right hand's position on classical guitar
I am a self-taught classical guitar player and recently, a more experienced player pointed out that my right hand position is incorrect as my wrist is bent down a lot. To solve this problem, I searched and found this site:

Fingerpicking Hand Position

The fingers are almost perpendicular to the strings, pointing down toward the floor and cupped as if holding a ball.

The thumb is out and away from the fingers.

The wrist is slightly arched, with a space between the wrist and the guitar.

The hand is bent down slightly at the wrist.




However, I still can't resolve the issue since if I want my fingers to be perpendicular to the strings I should bent down my wrist a lot and if I hold my hand similar to the left image, I touch the strings with corner of the my fingertips and it is not perpendicular to the string.


**Assistant:**
First off, while we would ideally all have full-length mirrors in our practice spaces, technique photos taken from the front of the guitar alone are just not so helpful.Once again I'm going to recommend [PRODUCT] (Amazon link). It has photos and diagrams from the player's point of view, which is much more helpful. It is available in paperback and Kindle formats. There is an entire chapter on right-hand position.Here are two excerpts:And here's a photo of my technique. My wrist is more bent, maybe too bent, but I'm comfortable and haven't been criticized on this by teachers. We all have to adjust positioning and technique details to suit our particular body shapes (which Duncan also discusses):One more important point about right hand position is that the forearm where the flexor muscles are largest should be approximately on the top corner of the lower bout of the guitar. This should be comfortable and rested but also able to apply slight pressure to the top of the guitar to counteract the fretting pressure applied to the fingerboard by the left hand. It is important to be conscious of this pressure and balance as part of right hand technique because the counter-force for the left hand fretting should not be the left hand thumb. The left hand thumb should only gently touch the back of the neck to provide stability and kinesthetic position sensing for the left hand fingers. The thumb muscles that provide ""pinching"" action should not be engaged in the left hand while playing classical guitar. Keep this fact in mind while refining your right hand and forearm positioning."

Can I Learn Ear Training Without the Ability to Audiate?
I asked a question a couple days ago along the lines of ""can I become a pro musician if I can't audiate?"", which was rightly met with some opposition. I appreciate the responses I got on that post and apologize for the post's ambiguity (I'm new to the forum).
I've decided to rephrase the question in order to receive some more accurate/more objective feedback.
I'm currently in high school, and I signed up for AP Music Theory next year. I love music and love playing music, but I'm unsure if my inability to audiate (other than a weak inner monologue) will prevent me from succeeding in that class due to the class' emphasis on ear training. I can read and sight read fine; these things need work, but that's unrelated to the ability of my ear. I'm pretty poor at singing; I can sing along with a song well, but as soon as I try on my own I lose myself and forget certain details of the melody. I should note that I also have total aphantasia.
I would also like to know about improvisation (jazz). How much does one really rely on their ear when improvising? Or is it like speaking (you don't hear the words before you say them, they just come out).
I'm unsure if these things can be improved, or if I'm just unlucky. I'm still going to play music, even if I don't go pro or become godlike on my instrument, but I would really like to know what my limitations are. Basically, I don't want to spend most of next year trying to do something I physically just can't.
Thanks!
EDIT:
Sorry, I guess I didn't provide ask much information as I thought I needed. I play trombone, and have done so for a couple of years now. I'm pretty decent, I play in the wind ensemble of my school that does grade 4-5 pieces, and I know a bit of music theory (i.e. using Dorian over minor7 chords, as well as chord change dictation).


**Assistant:**
(Disclaimer: I learned about aphantasia from this question (or the one before it). I'm sure there are others with more informed experience. Also, from a few minutes of Googling it seems that aphantasia, like other neurological traits, exists on a spectrum and everyone's case is different. So... maybe the only way to know for sure what your personal experience will be like is to experience it!)As far as I can tell, it absolutely doesn't have to stop you, but it can present some challenges. After all, much greater challenges could be overcome; someone deaf from birth could certainly learn music theory, and I could imagine them even composing brilliant works. Your challenge is more on the scale of ""could a dyslexic person compete in a spelling bee"": certainly; they'd just have to work a bit harder.Really, this question could be posed as ""just how does internal audiation help in music theory or performance,"" and then figuring out how to work around the absence of those helps. Music theory is mostly analysis; it's taking musical material and explaining it. By the way, if you're curious, here's a good overview of what's covered in the course and exam (assuming you mean the U.S. AP system).It summarizes the activities under four main skills:SkillDescriptionAnalyze Performed MusicApply musical terms, concepts, and relationships to performed music (aural).Analyze Notated MusicApply musical terms, concepts, and relationships to notated music (written).Convert Between Performed and Notated MusicApply conventions of musical notation and performance in converting music between aural and written forms.Complete Based on CuesComplete music based on cues, following 18th-century stylistic norms.""Analyze performed music"" means you'll hear a bit of music played and have to identify things about it. This might be very specific, like ""here is a multiple-choice option of three notated versions that vary in rhythm or pitch; which one was played,"" or perhaps broader like ""was that a full cadence or a half cadence."" In these cases, you'll be able to hear the audio example, so you won't have to ""imagine"" the notes from scratch. Where you might have a disadvantage compared is, after hearing the example played, someone without aphantasia could keep ""replaying"" the music to themself as they consider their analysis. If your experience lets you ""replay"" the immediate memory of a phrase then you're in luck; if not, I suggest jotting down whatever shorthand notes about it you can while it's playing.""Analyze notated music"" is right in your wheelhouse: all the information is on the page. Inner audiation would still be an advantage here; we often learn intervals, chords, etc. by focusing on ""what they sound like,"" and someone with inner audiation could look at the example and imagine that experience, just as an actor could read lines and imagine the timbre and diction with which they would deliver them. But you can absolutely look at two notes and calculate their interval by counting the half steps between them, whether or not you hear it. I always advise people to learn music theory at a [PRODUCT], and to play every example. I suspect that hearing it as you learn could still be of some value, at least in understanding concepts like pitch space on an experiential level, even if you can't replicate that experience on command.""Convert between performed and notated music"" means either that you'll hear a bit of audio and be asked to notate it (or to fill in a partially completed notation), or that you'll be given notated music and asked to perform it (in ways that don't depend too much on performative skill, like clapping a rhythm). You probably apply similar skills with language. If you can read written language out loud, or take dictation as someone speaks, these are just the musical equivalents. They may be more challenging since you've worked with spoken language since birth and written language since only a few years later, and most people have less experience with music notation. But any prior experience you already have will help, and you'll train these skills during the course. If you lack inner visualization as well as audiation, this could be a disadvantage during dictation, as someone else might hear an A and imagine it on the staff. But while this person has a shortcut, as long as you can distinguish up and down and relative distance, and accustom yourself to the sounds of thirds, fourths, fifths, etc., you can take dictation.""Complete based on cues"" might seem like the skill that would challenge you most. This means you'll get a fragment of music and be asked to add to it. But this is not ""free composition"" subject to your own whimsy; the test is looking for you to have a working knowledge of a number of ""plug-and-play"" conventions. For instance, if you get a four-bar phrase that ends with a dominant chord, you would probably follow it with another four bars, quoting the same melodic material, but altering its ending to cadence on the tonic. If you become familiar enough with the tools, this doesn't require ""inspiration,"" just knowing which tool to choose."

how do you pair amplifiers and speakers?
Contradicting rules of thumb:

amp should be 2x speaker wattage so the amp doesn't struggle
speakers should be slightly higher rating so they don't blow up

In stereo systems or any combo of amp and speakers put together by a manufacturer, I've never seen an amp that was double the speaker wattage but not pushing the amp seems like a legitimate theory.
That also means that you would need to be aware of your volume at all times to save your speakers.
the opposite could be said for protecting the amplifier with high power speakers though. you could technically run the amp at 100% which would shorten its life span, I think.
which way is better, in general, for a stable combination that will last?
EDIT: Here's a couple of references to show my confusion:
Note: these are summarized and not directly quoted from their sources. Links provided.
Matching Speakers With Amps As Far As Wattage? - InSync

normally recommend around twice as much amplifier power as speaker’s power rating. the idea is to have enough clean power to handle whatever you throw at the amp without clipping.
the extra power is to be kept in reserve so the amp can deal with peaks and transients without clipping.

How to Match a Cab to Your Head - InSync

speaker cabinet’s power handling must match or exceed the maximum output power of the amp head. If the power handling of the speaker is too low, then you may damage your cabinet, amplifier, or both.



**Assistant:**
I've realized my ""answer"" wasn't an answer, so I'm going to give you a few guidelines for matching for a small PA:Choose [PRODUCT] first based on the system design goals. Only choose [PRODUCT] that have complete published specs. At minimum, you need frequency response (3 dB down points), sensitivity (dB SPL @1W/1m), continuous, program, and peak power dissipation ratings (in Watts), maximum SPL, and nominal load impedance. These JBL specs are a good example. I personally wouldn't buy anything that did not have all those specs publicly available.When matching the [PRODUCT], if you want a simple guide, try to find an [PRODUCT] that has maximum power matching the rated program dissipation of the [PRODUCT] at the nominal load impedance.The main limiting factors you'll run up against are cost and weight. The best stuff is more expensive and heavier. You can deal with weight by buying a system with a larger number of lighter components, but that will cost you more in the end and be harder to set up.If you buy an [PRODUCT] that has power capability lower than the program rating of the [PRODUCT], the negative consequence is that you paid for capability in your [PRODUCT] that you can't realize using your [PRODUCT]. The positive consequence is you have more leeway for unexpected peaks to not cause over-excursion of the drivers.If you buy an [PRODUCT] that has a power capability higher than the program rating of the [PRODUCT], then you overbought the [PRODUCT] and you are more capable of accidentally overheating the drivers or causing over-excursion. The positive consequence is more system headroom and possible lower audible self-noise, as long as you're careful about your levels.Some engineers will warn against buying an underpowered [PRODUCT] for an additional reason. They theorize that when you buy too little [PRODUCT], you're more likely to turn up all your levels, to the point of overdriving your [PRODUCT] into clipping. IMHO if you can't hear your [PRODUCT] clipping and have the maturity to back down, your primary problem is not that you underbought your [PRODUCT], it's that you have no business running live sound. In any case, clipping adds power bandwidth, up to double the Watts going through the [PRODUCT]. This won't increase the risk of over-excursion but causes much higher than expected heating of drivers which can lead to failure.Overall, it's not a simple thing. When you combine all the considerations of cost, weight, damping factor, power ratings (three different kinds), bandwidth & power bandwidth, impedance, etc., etc., it's really much easier to buy [PRODUCT]. You can easily design a system these days that doesn't need an FOH rack or an analog snake.Revisiting some points from your question:[PRODUCT] should be 2x [PRODUCT] wattage so the [PRODUCT] doesn't struggle[PRODUCT] should be slightly higher rating so they don't blow upBoth wrong. Just ignore both of these points. Neither is helpful. The first one is nonsense and the second one isn't precise enough to do you any good.you could technically run the [PRODUCT] at 100% which would shorten its life span, I think.Not really. If you run your [PRODUCT] hot the things that will fail first are your [PRODUCT], not your [PRODUCT]. Solid state [PRODUCT] can handle a lot. If you underload them, that can easily shorten their lifespans. If you don't provide adequate ventilation, that can shorten their lifespans. If they are cheap and poorly made, then running them hotter might shorten their lifespans. A QSC or Crown [PRODUCT] run ""at 100%"" with appropriate load impedances attached and ventilation should last for years. But most [PRODUCT] won't sound very good running ""at 100%"", so for other reasons, this is not a good plan.Source: I designed, built, and ran small PA [PRODUCT] professionally for about 15 years.I’m curious your source for this “rule”:[PRODUCT] should be 2x [PRODUCT] wattage so the [PRODUCT] doesn't struggleBecause it makes no sense. Why would the [PRODUCT]’s nominal output capacity being less than the connected [PRODUCT]’s rated dissipation cause the [PRODUCT] to “struggle”?The problem with running an [PRODUCT] “at 100%” is not that it would wear out the [PRODUCT], but that the clipping would essentially double the actual power that had to be dissipated by the [PRODUCT].If you want to design a [PRODUCT] that is loud enough, sounds good, can be operated safely and does not destroy itself during normal use, you’ll have to learn a lot more than can be relayed in a stack exchange answer.Or you can just buy [PRODUCT] and not have to worry about any of it."

What is the name of this synth guitar?

                
            
Can anyone tell me what the name is of the guitar in this video?


**Assistant:**
As Tom mentioned they do have strings but they are bendy and very low tension, and as Data_Processing pointed out its a DG-20 and the frets are actually pressure sensors. I assume the bridge has some kind of vibration sensor and when a string is played it sounds the pitch that should correspond to the string and current fret sensor combination. They are very weird to play, and a lot of them these days are clunky and unreliable to get a note because the sensors get old and dirty, but a good one should be pretty sensitive.However I would contest the statement that they are not fun to play :). Certainly don't expect to be able to extract (anywhere NEAR) a [PRODUCT] like performance out of them, they don't respond to a lot of [PRODUCT] type nuance and have quite a significant delay. But linked to a external [PRODUCT] via MIDI I've found them really fun to quickly put together interesting sounds/parts for a song, primarily with [PRODUCT] pads. They are interesting to use if your [PRODUCT] playing is stronger than your keyboard playing (as is my case) or just to get you to approach playing a [PRODUCT] in a different way, where different voicings naturally present themself, they've made from some cool parts in songs of some of my old bands.The one in the video seems pristine, I would imagine that getting/using one these days would be a bit of a labour of love though, once you had restored it to its proper sensitivity level and gotten used to the truly odd feeling strings. You'd almost certainly get the same result but better using a modern [PRODUCT]. The onboard sounds are just your typical Casio style selection of the keyboards of that era (FM based I think?). If I saw one in a junk shop for £40 I would go for it and expect a bit of fun/pain getting it working, but no more. Probably one of the oddities of an already fairly zany era for electric instruments, and certainly not a classic, but it's uniqueness maybe counts for something to some people (or maybe just me!)"

Ableton routing MIDI file CC to synth parameter
I am fairly new to manipulate raw MIDI files, but I've had a couple of years of experience using Ableton.
I've been trying to generate some MIDI files using code (I'm using Julia with the MIDI.jl package). My goal is to use these file and read them into Ableton. I can do this fine now. However, I am trying to map the parameters in Ableton to a specific CC number that is in the MIDI track.
To clarify: I am generating a .mid file, dragging it on an Ableton track. Suppose the MIDI file has an oscillation from 0 to 127 on CC 73, I'd like this to control the frequency cutoff of Filter 1 in Analog (basically acting as an LFO modulating the filter).
With a USB controller I know that I can go in the MIDI mapping mode (cmd + m), select the parameter I want to control and then tweak the knob I want to use to control the parameter. However, I'm looking to do this without an external controller.
I cannot seem to add any MIDI mapping in the MIDI mapping mode without a controller (just with my laptop). Something that I think might work is creating a mapping using a controller and afterward changing the destination and sources of the mapping. I don't have a controller with me right now, so I can't check that... and it would also be convenient to have the possibility of a workflow without a controller.
I'm using Ableton 10 Suite. There might be a way of doing this with Max for Live, but I'm hoping that there is a quick fix that only uses Ableton.
I'm thinking that another workaround might be with the generation of the MIDI file itself. Maybe I could make the MIDI file to create some equivalent CC message that would directly affect Analog? I do not know enough about the structure of MIDI files to know if this is possible.
Thanks in advance for any help!


**Assistant:**
I think what you want to do is not possible. In my personal opinion, it really should be.It is possible to do MIDI mapping in Live without a MIDI controller, but not without using a third-party [PRODUCT]. What you would do is install and configure the [PRODUCT] to route MIDI from Live back into Live. Then you setup a MIDI clip in Live and add an envelope with data points for the CC that you want to map. Set the inputs and outputs so that the MIDI clip plays the CC messages out to the router and then back into the track that has the instrument you want to control. Play the MIDI clip, enter MIDI map mode, and select the control you want to map the CC number to and it should map. Repeat as needed.If you think that's ridiculous, I agree. I found no other way to edit MIDI maps."

digital piano has plastic clunking sound
I've had the Yamaha Digital Piano P-45 (~$500) for about seven years now - and it's fine, except that while playing (and recording with an iPhone nearby), I can prominently hear the plastic keys plunking - almost as loud as the speaker.
Do all entry-level digital pianos have such an audible plastic plunking sound? If so, how can it be mitigated?
Example recording


**Assistant:**
All digital pianos will have some kind of mechanical extraneous sound, but the clicking from your digital piano is exceptionally loud. (Either that, or you recorded your example with the volume very low.)One way to get around this extra noise while recording is to record the line out signal from the piano. You should be doing this anyway, unless you particularly like the sound through a certain keyboard amp. If your piano does not have line outputs, but does have a [PRODUCT] output, you can use a [PRODUCT] to plug both [PRODUCT] and a [PRODUCT] or PC to your piano. Specifically, you will need a ""[PRODUCT]"" or ""[PRODUCT]"".For practice, you can use [PRODUCT] to isolate you from the clicking sounds coming from the piano, if they bother you. If you're playing with other people, [PRODUCT] may not be an option, but you're probably playing loudly enough (with a keyboard amp) that the clicking is not an issue.As far as physically solving the problem at the source, solutions available will depend on the construction of your keyboard. Many keyboards will have a strip of felt that the keys touch when depressed all the way, which could be replaced, either with fresh replacement felt, or maybe some slightly thicker felt. I believe this is the replacement for the model mentioned in the question. I am not endorsing this seller. For weighted models, there may also be cushion strips for the hammers. Example Example If your keyboard has those cheap plastic-shell type keys, where the underside is accessible, then maybe you could try sticking some type of adhesive-backed gel or rubber pads in there to damp the keys."

Splitting MIDI Channels for Left and Right Hand on Yamaha Clavinova CSP-275 (Streamlight)
I recently purchased a Yamaha Clavinova CSP-275 digital piano that comes with the Stream Lights function. I've been trying to import a song (piano only song) into the piano for practice purposes. While trying to use the ""audio to score"" function, I only got some chords and the melody was missing.
After some digging, I found a solution to import my MIDI file:

I placed my MIDI file in Android/data/jp.co.yamaha.smartpianist/files/user_midi.
I realized the recordings I was making on my piano were in SMF 0 format, which contains only a single track.
I edited my MIDI file to only include the track containing the music. After placing it back on the tablet, the Smart Pianist app recognized the file and displayed the score correctly, with the Stream Lights also being accurate.

However, I have encountered one final challenge: All the notes in my song are for the right hand. This means I can't practice my left hand or right hand separately. I understand that MIDI files have multiple channels, which I believe might differ from tracks. I assume that perhaps the first channel is for the right hand and the second for the left, but I'm not entirely sure.
Could anyone provide an example of a MIDI file or an explanation on how to separate the two hands in a MIDI composition, specifically for the Yamaha Clavinova CSP models with the Stream Lights function ?


**Assistant:**
I wanted to provide an update regarding my original inquiry about splitting the MIDI channels for the left and right hands.My initial intuition about the two channels was correct. After diving into it further, I found that the first channel typically represents the right hand and the second channel represents the left hand in many MIDI compositions for piano.Using this understanding, I was able to successfully split my MIDI file into two distinct channels for separate hand practice. For those looking to achieve the same, it might be helpful to use [PRODUCT] to visually confirm and adjust channels as needed."

How to clean this guitar hardware?
I neglected my guitar a little bit in the last years. Didn't do anything crazy with them; it just hung on the wall and when I played it I didn't really clean it.
I know how to clean and maintain the wood and the frets, this question is about the metals parts, mainly the bridge and the pickup frames, as you can see in the pictures.


I know it looks bad, and yes, I have cats^^. I guess it's a good example what happens when you don't clean your guitar regularly, but I hope I can still save it, especially the bridge, because it would be quite expensive to change it. I don't really know what kind of material the knobs, the bridge, and the frames are; I didn't find anything online. It is an Ibanez S771PB NTF from 2014. The screws I will try to replace.
How would you suggest to clean these parts? I also plan to disassemble the parts to clean them throuroghly.


**Assistant:**
The pots should clean up with either a damp microfibre, or maybe a bit of [PRODUCT].The bridge & pickup surround look like an entirely different challenge. They don't just look dirty, they look like the electro-plating has corroded, exposing the brass underneath, which has also started to corrode.I looks like it's been left either in a damp or very humid location, or never even wiped down after a sweaty session.It will be the same reason the ferrous screws have rusted.You could try [PRODUCT], which will shift the verdigris [the green bits] to clean up the exposed brass. The plating will never recover, but might not get much worse if you use a [PRODUCT] that also claims to protect.Needless to say, you're going to have to strip them off the guitar & break them down into components to be able to get underneath, or there's little point in starting.Oh, I see on closer examination the plating is also gone on the pots. It will be [PRODUCT] for them too, in that case.You'll never get it to look like new again, too much damage has been done."

What transformation corresponds to the z-relation?
Forte's list of set classes includes some pairs that are ""z-related"" -- you can't get one from another through transposition and inversion, but they have the same interval vectors. Every interval vector is shared by at most two set classes.
Given a set class, such as 6-z3 (012356), is there a known transformation that produces its z-partner, in this case 6-z36 (012347)?
By ""transformation"" I mean a mathematical procedure to change from one PC set to the other. For example, multiplication by 11 (mod 12) transforms each PC set to its inverse -- which operation transforms each PC set to its z-partner?
In the specific case of 6-note sets we have the Hexachordal Theorem, so we can define the required transformation as taking the complement. I'm looking for a generalized transformation that works for any cardinality.


**Assistant:**
The problem identified here is the subject of deep research in set theory, category theory, crystallography, and music theory — to name a few. There is no known generalized transformation that works across cardinalities.Emmanuel Amiot's [PRODUCT] [PRODUCT]: Discrete Fourier Transform in Music Theory (Springer, 2016) might be of interest.

Wireless Sustain Pedal?
Not sure if this is the appropriate place to ask this question but I don't actually know where I should so I'll ask here anyways. So if someone could point me in the right direction before closing this post or something, that'd be appreciated.
I want a wireless sustain pedal for keyboards... Haven't been able to find them or any indication then exist on the internet lol.
So I was wondering if anybody could take me through a process of what it would take to make one.
I have a feeling this has more to do with circuitry than music, but yk.

So I was basically wondering what the process would be like to covert one of these box pedals to a wireless device.
Obviously it needs a dongle... those technically exist already

The picture is of a dongle ""pedal plug"" for wireless tattoo foot pedals, which operates somewhat like a cross between a guitar expression pedal and a keyboard sustain pedal.
Anyways, what would it take to use these two devices as one unit?
Ideally I'd like project instructions, tho I understand it would probably be theoretical instructions bc I dont think this has rly been done.
And would my suggested approach for the receiving end even work since the dongle's design isn't an on/off circuit?


**Assistant:**
This can probably be done yourself, it depends a bit your experience with electronics/embedded programing. Here is an idea, there a multiple way of doing it.There are basically three things this device should do:sense the state of the pedal (device #1)transmit it to the other donglesend it to the keyboard (device #2)These can all be done for instance with cheap hardware like [PRODUCT], I'll consider the case where you have a boolean sustain pedal (on/off), which typically are connected via a mono jack but this should be easily adaptable to an analog one.Device #1 (plugged into the pedal)Here, a simple [PRODUCT] connected to a Jack (sleeve to ground, tip to a digital pin set as input pullup) would be completely enough for a start. One problem I see there is that this will need to be powered somehow. If you initial goal was to get rid of cables it might be worth moving to batteries…TransmittingThat's a bit more challenging but there are a lot of options to transmit information between two such devices like bluetooth (probably the easiest but would be a bit concerned with latency), RF (probably better on that, might be subjected to interference)… Whatever protocol you choose, you'll need a transmitter (on device #1) and a receiver (on device #2).Device #2 (plugged into the keyboard)This should also be straightforward: a [PRODUCT], connected to a Jack (sleeve to ground, tip to an output pin) and switching between high-impedance state of this last pin and output to ground. Not completely sure how fast such a transition is but I doubt it is very slow. Of course, this transition would be triggered by information received on the receiver (whatever protocol you are using).This is not a complete solution, merely a guide as nothing is implemented but sounds like a fun first project if you want to dive a bit into electronics!"

On stage earplugs - what do I technically need?
I'm rehearsing and playing live with a band who work at very high sound levels that I find uncomfortable, and after some discussions it's obvious that I'm going to have to get used to it (or leave, which I don't want to do).

Obviously individual gear recommendations are out of scope for MSE - but what high-level technically should I be looking at?

And will the same product also protect my ears as an audience member at very loud concerts, or are there different requirements / specs for plugs for performers compared to plugs for audience members?

**Assistant:**
Good earplugs for performers and audience have quite similar specs: Relatively flat frequency response, attenuation that is suitable for the listening environment (usually somewhere around 15dB) and good enough fit that the plugs are comfortable enough to wear for the duration of the concert or rehearsal, and that they work as intended and do not leak. The comfort part is more important if you wear them for rehearsals several times per week than if you wear them for concerts every now and then.[PRODUCT] have usually the best fit, and I would recommend having a pair made if your budget allows. Otherwise the best bet is to try out different ""[PRODUCT]"" until you find a model that works for you."

Is there a way to learn to appreciate music in major key?
I am unable to appreciate music in major key and it seems to be something I was born with. In early childhood I already had a preference for some nursery rhymes while disliking others. Only when I learned some music theory a few years later did I realize the nursery rhymes I liked were all in minor key. It became more obvious since I started to listen to classical music. I simply cannot appreciate pieces in major key. Some are ""tolerable"" (like major key movements in a minor key symphony, only in slow tempo though) while most just sound kind of annoying to me.
What's wrong with me? Is this something that can be fixed? I'm kind of running out of ""right"" music to listen to recently and would very much love to expand my preference for music.


**Assistant:**
I taught a ""music appreciation"" course once, and after a lot of thought I titled it ""Enjoying Music."" The term ""music appreciation"" is burdened with a lot of implications that are not particularly helpful. It's very judge-y, and cloaks extremely subjective and culture-centric assumptions in objective language. It's usually weaponized in support of ""classical"" music, and the underlying narrative is ""This is 'music' (other kinds of music don't count, and that's why we can just use the word 'music' in our Music Appreciation title while ignoring them), and not only that, it's Great Art, and if you don't like it there must be something wrong with you. It's not that ""it's not great to you""; rather, its greatness is universal and objective and you simply don't appreciate it. Maybe you're a Philistine, or 'have no ear for music,' and there's no hope for you. But maybe you were simply never 'taught to appreciate it,' because kids-these-days, support-for-the-arts, yada yada. Let's try to fix that by subjecting you to a course that insists that you're wrong and we're right.""This stance doesn't fit with modern musicology, and isn't particularly helpful. I'd prefer to replace it with something like this:Sure, there are some kinds of music that you're not currently ""into."" Let's give them a chance. Why? Not because they're better musics, or inherently deserving of ""appreciation."" And not because there's something wrong with you that needs to be fixed. But because your life might be richer for it. That's the goal: you currently enjoy some music. Let's explore some more, and you might enjoy it as well, and maybe even get more enjoyment from the music you currently consume, after thinking and learning about it more.The outcome might not be that you want to listen to that kind of music all the time. My life is enriched by knowing about Schoenberg, or Javanese gamelan, or Gesualdo, or shakuhachi music, but I don't blast any of them on my car speakers with the windows down. (Though I have been known to do that with Steve Reich, or maybe even the occasional Gesualdo...) But by encountering and trying to understand them, I have a richer context that brings me more enjoyment as I blast the Beach Boys or RJD2.So what do we do? I argue that we can enjoy a music more when we understand it, and when we encounter it on its own terms. That means doing a little digging into its background. Knowing about Shostakovich's political and personal turmoil helps us get more out of his Fifth Symphony or Eighth String Quartet. Indian classical music is more meaningful when we know more about ragas and talas. Music is a cultural artifact, and it does it a disservice to surgically remove it from its cultural surroundings and, as it were, hang it on a museum wall as an ""object"" in isolation. Any time we encounter an unfamiliar music, it's just a series of sounds until we know more about it. And if we lack the framework with which to listen to it, we can't even make sense of those sounds. If I'm unfamiliar with Indian classical music, it might ""all sound the same,"" because all I can hear is the difference between it and my familiar musics, rather than the differences between pieces.So proactive ""music enjoyment"" takes a little work. Research into the historical, cultural, or personal factors that created the music. It also takes, well, exposure. Why would we read entire [PRODUCT] about, say, Brahms without also listening to his music? And yet all too often we do. So don't rush into the music without doing some research, but don't stop at the research without also spending time with the music itself. Try to encounter it as it was meant to be encountered. Are you meant to sit quietly and simply pay close attention to this music (as with much ""classical"" music)? Are you meant to dance to it? Are you meant to ""zone out"" while listening to it? Was it created to do physical work to? Was it originally meant to be enjoyed not in isolation but in social settings, like a jazz club or a communal event? Try to ""enjoy music"" in other ways than on your own through headphones. Go to concerts, go to open-mic nights, go to dances, go to ethnic cultural festivals.Finally, getting this kind of informed and experiential understanding of one kind of music helps us get more insight into other kinds. You write that you like minor, dislike major, and are ""running out of music to listen to."" But the good news is that music that even thinks about major vs minor is a narrow slice of all the human music! European music didn't even think along those lines for centuries, and many other musical traditions organize around other frameworks. I'd recommend taking (or giving yourself) a crash course in Western music history and in global ethnomusicology. Buy used copies of, or find in a library, [PRODUCT] on these topics, especially if they come with CDs (or just look up and listen to the pieces they reference). When I made my course I relied a lot on [PRODUCT]'s A [PRODUCT] (it has a lot of pretty pictures) and [PRODUCT]'s [PRODUCT], but there are others and maybe some newer [PRODUCT]; [PRODUCT]'s [PRODUCT] looks good."

Is it possible to perform a chromatic glissando on harp?
How is it possible to perform a chromatic glissando in a fast passage on a harp, as in the example below?



**Assistant:**
On the [PRODUCT]- not very quickly. The [PRODUCT] does not have a string for each chromatic note; rather, it has one string for each note in Cb major, and the pitches of strings can be altered with pedals to play any note in any key. You can't have more than 7 notes per octave immediately accessible, so a chromatic glissando like the one shown in the question would require the player to alter and re-strum several individual strings very quickly. Not viable.If you want the glissando to sound atonal, you may try starting with a glissando through the notes of Cb major only, and adding some sharps so that many of the notes fall outside the key of the piece.Alternatively, you can require the player to use a [PRODUCT] which is truly chromatic."

What is the preferred musicology term for ""classical music""?
What is the preferred, more precise English-language musicology term for the genre of music which North Americans typically call “classical music”? I mean the broader meaning of ""classical"", which includes composition before and after the ""Classical era"" of 1730 to 1820.
For instance, I have heard this genre called “Western European Art Music”. What is the preferred term among experts? What is the preferred technical definition for this kind of music?
An answer to another question suggests the definition is ""all music that is written with the art form itself as a top priority."" That is a good start, but maybe we can do even better. Perhaps the definition should include the Western European, even German and Italian, roots of the genre.
Adam Neely's video Music Theory and White Supremacy suggests replacing the phrase ""music theory"" with ""the harmonic style of 18th century Western European musicians"", as a way of revealing the framing of ""classical music"" as the pinnacle of music across all cultures. I suspect the term I am looking for would avoid that framing.


**Assistant:**
Heh, the problem isn't really with the choice of label, it's that the thing it labels is really hard to pin down. Most attempts wind up meaningless or controversial.But there is a colloquial usage, obviously. A radio station near me claims to play ""Great Classical Music."" Well, what do they not play? No rock and roll. No jazz. No hip hop. Generally, the most useful man-on-the-street sense of what makes something ""classical"" has a lot to do with the instruments used. Adding a violin to the band Yellowcard doesn't make them classical, and adding a drum set to a symphony orchestra for Rhapsody in Blue doesn't make it not-classical, but in general, using the instruments of the symphony orchestra tends to cause a perception of ""classical.""But obviously this colloquial sense is of little use to scholarly discussion. Is a movie soundtrack ""classical""? Many will vehemently deny it. The classical radio station is unlikely to play it. (But they will play music from ballets or operas...) Is a Vitamin C String Quartet cover of a pop song ""classical""? Is John Cage's 4'33"" (a piece consisting of silence) classical? Is Steve Reich's Electric Counterpoint, written for/with jazz guitarist Pat Metheny? What about when Johnny Greenwood, guitarist from Radiohead, plays it? What about when Steve Reich reworks Radiohead songs in Radio Rewrite?If one's scholarship were sociological, it could be a rich (perhaps impossible) task to parse all these conflicting uses. But in the meantime, rather than find a different label, it's better to nail down exactly what one is talking about.The term ""art music"" is marginally more useful, but still very problematic. It carries a lot of baggage. It's a step more generous than simply talking about ""music,"" and then talking in a way that ignores non-classical genres. It admits that folk music and pop music are actually ""music,"" but then it tries to exclude them, and the word it chooses for that purpose is ""Art."" There's already plenty of ink spilled over that word, clear back to the ancient Greeks, and we're implying that folk music and pop music are not ""art."" Functionally, the best this term can do is try to focus on the ""use"" and context of the music. Is it played in a concert hall, or an outdoor festival? Is it played to people who sit still and listen to it, or is does it contribute to another activity, like dance music in a club? Ultimately, this distinction will break down under scrutiny as well. A string quartet, a jazz combo, and an indie rock band might all play in medium-size venues, to attentive audiences who came specifically to hear them. The only distinctions become cultural ""highbrow""/""lowbrow""/""middlebrow"" tokens. We even open the door to the implication that ""Art"" is the opposite of ""Entertainment,"" and that therefore ""classical"" equals ""serious music"" (as opposed to what? music that can smile?). I once saw, backstage in a concert hall, an old lighting control console from the 1920s, no longer in use. Someone had added joking labels to the various dials and levers. One was a big handle that pivoted vertically, and the top of the scale was labeled ""Art"" and the bottom ""Entertainment."" Phrases like ""art music"" lead inevitably to this lever—the more fun it is, the less artistic, and vice versa.The best thing, then, is to narrow your topic of discussion. Are you talking about the social role of classical music institutions? It's easy enough to talk specifically about symphonies, opera companies, etc. Are you contrasting this music with that of another global music-culture? I often use ""Western tonal tradition"" or words to that effect to mean ""the monolithic musical practice that derives mostly from European origin, starting roughly in the baroque, and that became codified by these social institutions like symphonies and continues to be practiced by them, and that is marked by musical conventions like tonality and regular meter."" But if at all possible it's more fruitful to draw more specific comparisons. I once wrote a paper about how ""classical music"" came to be such a big deal to Chinese culture, but it's a story of individual connections and influences, of a clavichord in the Emperor's court and a symphony in Shanghai. I got most of it from the [PRODUCT] [PRODUCT] by Sheila Melvin and Jindong Cai. (I highly recommend it, a great read.) Note that they, at least, pick the term ""[PRODUCT],"" but they devote a paragraph to talking about the fact that they picked it.Throughout the writing of [PRODUCT], we have grappled with our use of the term ""classical music."" It is a phrase that we find to be deeply flawed and woefully inexact, but largely unavoidable. Because it had not yet been coined during most of the time period covered in Chapter 2, we have substituted ""European music"" instead. But in writing about the missionaries who used music as a tool of conversion and education in the 19th and early 20th centuries, we switch to ""Western music"" since many of them were American and the music they taught was not strictly-speaking ""European"" or ""classical."" However, as we got deeper into the 20th century, we were largely forced to drop ""Western music"" because by then the term could include jazz, pop, rock, disco, and rap, none of which we discuss. So, for the title of [PRODUCT] and through many of its chapters, we have been obliged to use the phrase ""classical music"" to refer to a broad range of music that was originally brought to China from the West and includes the clavichord, the military march, opera, the symphony, the piano concerto, and more. If the phrase and our use of it are far from perfect, we at least find comfort in the fact that even The Oxford Dictionary of Music defines classical music as a ""term which, applied to music, has vague rather than specific meaning."" (p.3)And that's about the only way we can talk about these things—defining the scope of your conversation, and taking time to talk about the terms you've chosen, their inherent problems, and what you mean for them to mean.Update: I feel like, after that, I'm lacking a clear answer to the original question, ""If 'classical music' is an inadequate label, what term should I use?"" My answer, then would be:First, try not to talk about such a monolithic and poorly-defined entity. Wherever possible, talk about more specific slices of history and culture. And,If you must talk about it (e.g. if you're talking about the sociological phenomenon of people perceiving a body of ""classical music""), I don't know that any other label would avoid the same problems with definition and boundaries. Instead, do as Melvin and Cai did above; be open about its problems and clear about what meanings and boundaries you intend, and when you discuss others' use about it, make their meanings clear as well (or call out their unclearness)."

I know that I will get callus on chord finger tips, but how about strumming thumb?
Will it turn into callus? or it will get bad because the more I am playing, the more skin is going off, flesh is turning a little red, and it is hurting a little.



**Assistant:**
There's a joke:MAN: Doctor, I get a shooting pain when I raise my arm like this.DOCTOR: So don't raise your arm like that!Seriously, this is the simple answer to avoid so many performance injuries. If something hurts, stop. Maybe the pain tells you you're doing something wrong, but maybe it just means you're doing the right thing but too much of it. Even the best technique is subject to the limits of the human body.Especially when it comes to calluses: a callus is the skin's response to irritation. If you do small periods of irritation, repeated frequently over a long period of time, it forms a callus; if you do a long period of irritation over a short period of time you get a blister or wound.I'm not going to address whether your technique is correct, but regardless, shorten your practice session, and maybe change up what you're doing, doing some pick strumming or other exercises to give your thumb a break. In fact, you'll want to stop thumb-strumming entirely until that heals a bit. You can try a ""[PRODUCT]"" product to protect it and still have some flexibility."

Grand piano positioning to compromise between acoustic and good piano care
After owning a digital then an upright piano, I am now considering the possibility of acquiring a baby grand piano (166 cm / 5'5"" according to the manufacturer's website). But since a grand is, well, grand, I will no longer be able to stuff it inside a tiny room with relatively controlled environment anymore. As such, I am now considering the possibilities of having it in the living room.
The following is an approximation of how I would like to have it positioned:


The hole at the top is how you reach the living room/kitchen area. There is no door.
The living room is exposed to the kitchen, so I tried keeping the piano as far as possible to limit exposure to cooking.
The heat pump unit can generate heat for winter and work as an air conditioner for summer.
The windows at the bottom are located south, and on morning, you can see the sun reaching directly into the living room from there. I plan to add movable divider panels for that effect.
Neighbourhood is not a problem.

The way I see it, that looks like an optimal place to put the piano, since it will be far enough from the kitchen and will not be directly exposed to the heat pump. Plus, on an acoustic point of view, the sound will be projected directly throughout the entire room.
However, it is relatively close to the 2 windows (as insulated as they are, they are still windows, which can let cold air in during winter), which also lets the sun in during the morning. The dividers might mitigate the problem a bit, but only slightly.
Given the available space, is there a way I can optimise the acoustic while also protecting it from the sun, the kitchen, the heat pump and the windows drafts?


**Assistant:**
This setup looks good. By necessity, I had my grand piano by a window for a decade, with no ill effects. However, it did not receive direct sunlight, which is more of a concern. You'll definitely want a shade of some kind.The biggest issue for pianos is not the temperature (barring radical, rapid changes) but the humidity. Estimates vary, but most recommendations are between 45% and 70%, though consistency is the most important factor. You can purchase a [PRODUCT] to monitor humidity levels, and you can also purchase a [PRODUCT], which can raise and/or lower the humidity level at the piano's soundboard."

How can I test my strumming accuracy
I use a metronome to practice strumming on the guitar. I want to test how I'm doing without the metronome. Am I too fast, or too slow, do I hold the beat steady? What tool or technique can I use to test my accuracy?


**Assistant:**
`Easy, but won't work: Record yourself, then play the recording back with a [PRODUCT] running. This isn't very helpful, though, because if you set the [PRODUCT] to 60 bpm but play perfectly in-tempo at 59 bpm, then you'll be half a beat off in just a few measures. Unless you're a robot, you're unlikely to be able to hold an exact tempo, not even deviating by 1 bpm. The same problem would be true of this method; it could get out of sync just as easily.Better: Find a [PRODUCT] (or [PRODUCT]) with a ""tap"" feature. This means you hit a button every time you hear a beat, and it tells you the average tempo it's detecting based on those taps. Record yourself, play it back, and hit ""tap"" as you listen to your recording. If the average tempo varies by only a few bpm, you're amazing. If it varies wildly, you're in trouble.EDIT: After thinking about this question for a few days, something seems off: For the most part, anybody who can't keep a steady tempo knows it. I realize I might be mistaken in your problem. You mention ""beat"" and ""fast or slow,"" which made me think the overall concern was tempo—i.e. whether the beats are equally spaced—but you also mention strumming. Which usually means ""subdivisions""—a rhythm pattern of smaller notes that fit inside the beat. I wonder whether your concern is more about those small notes being accurately placed within the beat? Or, if you're thinking about beat/tempo, I would suggest that the problem might be that you're focusing on those rhythms. Let me explain:First: If you're worried about the rhythmic accuracy of the subdivisions: A good practice tool can be to force a [PRODUCT] to produce those subdivisions. This can be tricky since most [PRODUCT] only go up so high. But, say, if your song is at 100 bpm and your [PRODUCT] goes to 200, then at least set it to 200 and think of it as eighth notes. Then, if you're strumming sixteenth notes, you can at least check your timing halfway through the beat. Some [PRODUCT], like the physical ""[PRODUCT]"" or the [PRODUCT] ""[PRODUCT],"" can even output smaller divisions, like can beep sixteenth notes at any tempo, or some rhythm patterns like ""an eighth followed by two sixteenths"" (or, in the case of [PRODUCT], triplets against sixteenths!). Practicing with these subdivisions can be revealing; sometimes we're not playing what we think we are.But a lot of these answers have emphasized that it's not always desirable to play perfectly metronomically, and that's true here too. If multiple people are trying to play these rhythms exactly in sync, and want to be mathematically perfect about them, then great. But in general, as long as the big beats are in the right place, who cares whether the subdivisions are accurate? Lots of genres intentionally fudge the subdivisions, stealing from one part of the beat to give to another; that's the whole idea behind ""shuffle,"" or swing, or French baroque notes inegales. And if a whole ensemble can make the same fudgings equally, can get ""in the pocket"" together, that's when true ""groove"" is achieved.Second: even if you're still just talking about keeping the beats steady, it might be that your problem is that you're focusing on those small notes. Like, if your strumming pattern is an eighth note followed by two sixteenths (""one and a two and a three and a four""), then if you think of it this way: ""Okay, I play a note that's half a beat long. Then I play a note that's a quarter of a beat long. Then..."", then you're likely to wind up wandering in your tempo. Instead, focus on the big beats: ""one and a two and a..."". Feel the pulse of those, lock onto it, and let the ""little notes"" fall into place between them.When I first learned to drive a car, on the first day behind the wheel, I tried to steer by focusing on the road right in front of the car. ""Oh crap, I'm inches away from the line; veer left. Oh crap, now I'm too far from it; veer right. Oh crap..."" My driving instructor told me to instead look up to the farthest point I could see ahead and aim for that, and like magic, it was much easier to stay on course. Similarly, if we try to make a tempo by adding up dozens of ""little notes,"" we might make a lot of ""little mistakes"" and add up to being quite off, but if we focus on the ""big beats,"" we have more chances to check in and adjust.`"

Could it be the 9V battery? I bought it a few months ago and it was all working fine since yesterday. No drop or shock whatsoever.
It's having the same issue with a little Orange Amp and even more so with an iRig HD2 connected to my mac.

**Assistant:**
If you've left the jack in, the battery is probably below 9v, and it might have been borderline before. Worth replacing, and also use [PRODUCT] when plugging in all the jacks to their sockets. Move the jacks in and out a good few times, as dirty contacts will cause such effects."

Need help with opening passage of the 4th mvt of Mozart Symphony No. 39, 1st violin part

Hi,
I'm having a bit of trouble practicing this section of the piece. I've tried playing it slowly and gradually increasing the tempo, but I just cannot get it and it's quite frustrating. The problem is mainly in my bow; my left hand is fine. Does anyone have any tips?


**Assistant:**
This is a standard ""[PRODUCT]"" used in orchestral auditions. [PRODUCT] has an [PRODUCT] with him talking through his advice about various [PRODUCT] and demonstrating them. I highly recommend buying the whole [PRODUCT], but here's what he has to say about this [PRODUCT]:... and his demonstration:If you're playing in an actual orchestra, you don't have your own choice about bowing (unless you're the concertmaster). And if you're taking an audition, I would play it exactly as printed in the [PRODUCT] and not try to invent any improvements; the challenges presented by the bowing are an expected part of the audition.As [PRODUCT] notes, those slurs are the problem. In general, in fast passagework, our left hand can manage much more dexterity and speed than the bow can, and our job is to manage the bow to keep up with the left hand. First of all, the slurs cross strings. Yes, you could play the first couple of bars (mm. 16-17) in second position; this would have the double benefit of putting the slur all on one string, and putting the entire measure on only two, with no trip to the A string for the B flat. BUT we have no such option in mm. 18-19 (the ones that start on F); short of some crazy scheme of shifting back and forth between positions (inadvisable) we have no comfortable way to keep all the pitches on only 2 strings, or to avoid a string-crossing during the slur. That being the case, I don't know that I'd even bother with 2nd position in mm. 16-17; better to get the bowing pattern set up from the start. (Plus, if you have any interest in historicity, I doubt Mozart would have shifted to avoid string crossings.)Recognize that each subsequent measure will reverse bow directions (I would not advise doing anything to change that). Recognize that the actual physical movement you make during the slur is very different on a downbow than an upbow (think about the shape your right hand traces in the air—an arch, or an inverted arch). Get used to putting beats on upbows in the in-between measures.The best bit of general advice is to use as little bow as you can and still sound good. The slurs will move you (slightly) out of the ideal spiccato spot of the bow and you must work to get back; the less bow you use the lesser this problem. The ""scoopy"" arch-shaped motion of the downward string crossing on a downbow is less unwieldy on a shorter bow. If you're practicing by starting at a slow tempo and gradually increasing the metronome (a good idea), consider: if you use 2 cm of bow per note at 80 bpm, you should use 1 cm at 160 bpm. Can you get away with 0.5 cm? Produce a good, clean, sound, but see how little bow you need to do so.In the slurs, work on the timing of the string crossing. Don't just sort of ""blur"" from D string to G, moving in a continuous arc; ""pop"" from one string to the other at the exact timing of the 16th note, just as you would lift and drop your left hand fingers with precise timing. (This will help keep m. 20, a few measures later,...from coming out simply as a measure of double-stops!)Have you worked on collé? That is, a bow stroke that is powered by ""squeezing"" and extending the fingers? Although this passage doesn't use true collé, the finger motion that powers it is a magic ingredient in many (maybe all?) bowstrokes, from a beautiful lyrical legato to off-string strokes to string crossings. Consider minutely the way every part of your right arm, from shoulder to fingertip, contribute to the motion of this string crossing. You can accomplish a string crossing by moving the whole arm, from the shoulder; you can do it by moving only from the elbow; you could keep your forearm stationary and merely bend at the wrist; and you could even keep your whole arm and the palm of your hand in one plane and compress or extend your fingers to reach different strings. Start with this finger motion, and then add in as much of the larger motions as needed to stay natural and comfortable. In rapid passagework, do the most you can with the smallest muscles; nothing is worse than trying to whip your whole arm through these string crossings as if you're beating egg whites.It's great that you're practicing slowly and then at increasing tempos; that's the best start. Since so much of what makes these measures challenging is the bowing, try practicing the pattern of open strings that you'll be playing, without using left hand at all, so you can concentrate on the bow mechanics (e.g. ""Slur D to G; G; G; D; D; A; D""). Do the same for the left hand, moving your fingers without bowing.Consider what you can do to keep your fingering efficient. E.g. in the measure starting with F, it doesn't have to be ""Play 2, then 3, then 1, 3, 2, 4, 2, 4""; we think that way because of the dots on the page. Instead, look at your fingers moving in physical space. It could be: ""Place 2 and 3 on the F and C. Raise 3 to play the Ab. Lower 3. 2 is still down; rock slightly so that it contacts A string as well. Lower 4. Keeping 2 and 4 down, go to A string to play the C, and come back to D string for another Ab.""One challenge in passages that are all the same note value is to keep them even and equal. One way to practice these is to superimpose rhythmic patterns on them; try a ""long-short"" patter, dotting the first 16th and turning the second into a 32nd. Much harder, try the opposite, short-long! One long, plus a triplet-y 3 short? ""Short-long-long-short"" for syncopation? One benefit of these schemes is that it forces you to think about timing in the first place, and about how the mechanics of these motions conspire to rush or obstruct the timing. Another is that the ""short notes"" force you to make very quick motions, while the ""long notes"" give you a moment to think, so by combining multiple patterns you get the benefit of practicing very quickly without having to be so hyper-alert."

How is it possible to filter either high or low frequencies of a single sine wave?
I started learning music production. I created (or generated) a sine wave with the oscillator in FL Studio, but did not add any more sine waves into it (by turning the volume off for the two other oscillators;  the built-in synth in FL Studio has 3 oscillators in total). Then, I hold the key (it was the middle A) of my midi keyboard then adjusted EQ to see whether there would be any changes with the sound. Yes, the timbre (or the color -not sure about the terminology) changed.
The interesting thing is and the thing I don't understand is: the process with the electric guitar is logical because it is a 'real' instrument and it creates overtones; when someone adjust the treble-middle-bass knobs on the amp then the amp cut offs some frequencies. But in the aforementioned experiment, there was just a one, single sine wave and there was none overtones if I'm not mistaken. So, which frequencies were cut off by the EQ in the FL Studio? How did this happen?
To show the oscillator and EQ I use in FL I recorded my screen with the audio: https://streamable.com/9b3ifz


**Assistant:**
It's not possible, something went wrong with your experiment.The audio from your video sounds extremely aliased, and it doesn't match your eq moves, so I will assume that this is entirely a video artifact and not actually what you are hearing. If it is what you're hearing, something's gone terrible wrong between [PRODUCT] and your speakers.The [PRODUCT] [PRODUCT] runs in draft mode until you export your project*, and in draft mode, the sine waves generated are a bit less perfect than you might expect. I recreated your experiment, and I have to treble boost about 20dB for the aliasing to be even a little audible on middle A, but if you have brighter speakers and younger ears you might hear the aliasing sooner. Try the experiment again with the [PRODUCT] ""default"" preset, which generates a much cleaner (although still not perfect) sine wave and compare your results.In recreating your experiment, I also heard a significant amount of noise generated while moving the eq bands. This is totally an artifact of how the software takes inputs, and you should ignore this.*Even in render mode, [PRODUCT] is quite aliased, and the sine waves are still not quite sines, though the newest version has an ""HQ"" mode which is fully anti-aliased."

Any tips for cleaning a violin from the early 1900s to make it usable again
Recently my grandfather gave me my great-grandmother's violin. He told me this violin was handmade in the early 1900s and it is an extremely precious family heirloom. The last time this instrument was regularly used was in the 70s when my aunt was learning to play the violin. Since then it has been locked up in a case and over time the horsehair on the bows ""shed"" and left rosin everywhere. The violin looks extremely dirty and smells dirty.
From my piano experience, I know that you can't just use any cleaner to clean the finish. I really do not want to mess around cleaning this violin, especially with its age and sentimental value of it.
I have some cleaner which I use to clean my piano – would it be ok to use this to clean my violin? Or is there any method I should use? I do plan on using it.


**Assistant:**
You're right not to try applying cleaning products without fully knowing what you're doing. If you have a violin repair person or luthier in your area, I recommend you take it straight to them. They can give it a full beauty treatment, removing any layers of dirt and polishing as appropriate for the instrument. But more importantly, they can assess any repair that the violin surely needs, and even appraise its value. I would absolutely try to make this visit before trying to play or sell the instrument; even if there were no such expert near me I would travel if possible.If you absolutely can't get it to a professional, I might wipe it gently with a soft (like microfiber) [PRODUCT] and no cleaning product at all. (Even then, as Lazy's comment below mentions, you must wipe very gently to avoid scratching. If in doubt, leave it alone.) It also can't hurt to ""air it out""; you can get it out of the musty [PRODUCT], if you have a nice secure place to store it where it's protected and the room is not too hot or dry. If you plan to keep the instrument, you can also start shopping for a nice new [PRODUCT]; modern [PRODUCT] with suspension pads or carbon-fiber bodies can protect it better.NOTE: Although the question asks about doing an intensive cleaning on a very dirty violin, for the benefit of other users: how do you do regular daily cleaning on an instrument that's already in good playing shape? DO keep a clean, dry, soft [PRODUCT] in your [PRODUCT]; when you put the instrument away, wipe rosin dust gently from the entire belly including under the fingerboard and tailpiece. Wipe rosin dust from the bowing area of the strings and wipe sweat and oil from the fingering portion (it might be smart to use a second and third [PRODUCT] for these, so that your body [PRODUCT] stays clean longer, and you don't get the oil/sweat on the bowing area). Wipe rosin dust from the stick of the bow as well. That's it. Don't use any kind of product or solvent on any part of the instrument, no matter how it's labeled or marketed, no matter what Yehudi Menuhin used to do."

Why does plugging headphones directly into guitar effect sound ""bad""?
A few days ago I tried to plug my (OneOdio A71) headphones directly into my 9 V cheap mini Kokko overdrive. I was expecting to not hear anything, or almost anything, because it was my understanding that the output of the signal chain normally needs to be amplified to become powerful enough to drive speakers or headphones.
But, much to my surprise, it worked. Again, the following, works, I tried.
Humbuckers --> Overdrive pedal --> Passive mono to stereo adapter --> Stereo headphones
You can hear stuff, and it's pretty loud. But it does not sound great; it seems like the highs are too high, and there is some sort of harshness to it. I don't know exactly how to describe it. It's not necessarily a bad tone, but I don't like it for what I want to play.
So, the questions are:

Why does it sound so ""meh""?
Is it an impedance problem?
Would a headphone amplifier improve the sound?



**Assistant:**
Guitar [PRODUCT]/[PRODUCT] etc are designed to be fed to [PRODUCT].This isn't even really a problem of impedance or even output voltage, it's one of EQ curve.[PRODUCT] [& [PRODUCT]] really strip the top off any signal going into them. A 'bright' guitar tone is nowhere near as bright as you might think, it tends to tail off from as low as 3kHz or so & be almost non-existent by 10kHz.Because of this, a [PRODUCT] doesn't have to care about how much fizzy high end it's sending, the [PRODUCT] will strip it.Your headphones, on the other hand, will be good to 20kHz & you can now hear all that nasty high end, clear as day.You can hear the same thing if you route one to a hifi, or your audio rig's line in. Nasty fizzy noise.There was at one time a studio fashion to run a guitar straight into the desk - partly using the desk's own preamps to [PRODUCT]. The top end had to be rolled out quite heavily to make this work.The desire to be able to practise using overdriven sounds at low volumes was partly what drove the popularity of such as the [PRODUCT] 20 years ago. It emulated the sound of a [PRODUCT] [& [PRODUCT] with a switch], so headphones or direct line in would sound 'right'.You can pick up an original [PRODUCT] on eBay these days for about $£€ 50."

What are modes added with sharps and flats to make them sound better called?
I'm watching this video about modes and right here he mentions something that sounds like 'musica fikta' which he explains as sharps and flats added to modes to make them sound better (right when majors and minors were being invented in music history).
What's the correct spelling of 'musica fikta'? I'd like to look it up to learn more about it.


**Assistant:**
These ficta pitches were not really a part of the mode, but rather just decorative chromaticism.When discussing ficta, I think it's often helpful to remember when it was typically used: ficta notes would be briefly introduced right at moments of cadential arrival, and then they would typically be immediately abandoned. (I'm simplifying here, because there were other uses of ficta, but this is the clearest.)Imagine you're in A Aeolian—a very common mode and final for this style of music—and you have an interior cadence on D. In order to really push towards that D, the music will briefly introduce C♯, D's leading tone, to cadence on that D, and then revert to C♮ as the ""true"" third of the global A Aeolian.With all of this said, identifying mode in polyphonic music (e.g., Monteverdi's madrigals) can be rather difficult, and it's not really just a question of ""what notes are used""; in A Aeolian, you're going to find a lot of C♯s, F♯s, and G♯s.

How can you sustain a long note on electric guitar smoothly?
Sometimes a song calls for a very long sustained note, or a long sustaining chord, such that the length of the note is beyond what you can expect a guitar to naturally sustain, let alone sustain without its quality changing from loss of kinetic energy.
Clearly these are cases where you must revive the note by periodically picking it so that it will maintain its intensity and reach the required ringing time. However, whenever I try to do that, I am painfully aware of when the note is being re-picked. This is because picking interferes with its oscillation, and I feel like that’s noticeable, and because the attack of the pick is audible given enough distortion. And yet, I heard live recordings where a long smooth note was played without these issues.
How do guitar players do that?


**Assistant:**
Tetsujin gives a good answer (I upvoted), but I feel I can add some additional ideas.Compression is making quiet sounds louder and loud things quiet, and it is naturally something that amps do when pushed enough. There are techniques common in rock guitar, specifically tapping and harmonics, that could always have been done but weren't common until amplification and compression made it so these could be as loud as normal playing.Traditional guitar has always been a punchy high-attack low-sustain instrument, but with amplification and compression, you can get these longer notes and chords, but there eventually comes a point where the note fades.Clearly these are cases where you must revive the note by periodically picking it so that it will maintain its intensity and reach the required ringing time.There are techniques to handle this. There are technologies to handle this. The first one I can think of is tremolo picking, which you might recall from the meatball scene from Lady and the Tramp. Instead of strumming once and leaning on the sustain, you pick a lot, like on sixteenth notes or so, and let the continual picking be heard as sustain.Next is the addition of string vibration by feedback. The common way is by standing in front of the amp or monitor and letting the sound move the strings, which get amplified, and so on. The [PRODUCT] and [PRODUCT] [PRODUCT] use an electromagnet in the neck position to allow it to send the currently-played note back into the strings, not just pick it up. The [PRODUCT] and similar [PRODUCT] use magnets to just vibrate a string. It's similar to but different from the built-in [PRODUCT], in that it doesn't know what is being played. This all very much gets you into the infinite sustain thing.The pedal-steel guitar way is different, in that you use a [PRODUCT] and a loud clean amp. Here, you play the note, drop the volume to where you want it to be, and as the note decays, you add volume back, so it just sounds like the note sustains a long time. This is a bit like doing the same thing compressors do, just with your foot.Also, the [PRODUCT] and other infinite sustain [PRODUCT], kinda delay [PRODUCT] that just play back short samples of a previous note or chord.However, whenever I try to do that, I am painfully aware of when the note is being re-picked.There are a few things you can do, but this does skew more ambient and far less rock. The first is to swallow the pick attack. Compression can help a little, but my go-to here is use a [PRODUCT] to hide when I pick. Issue is, now instead of that new click, you get silence.This is when you use delay and reverb to hide the point in time when the strum or fade happened."

Is there a recorder-analog for the flute?
I have used soprano baroque recorders for students aged 8-10 as a ""pre-band"" instrument.  I find that most students enjoy practicing note-reading, and the average student is able to progress reasonably far in two years of study.  I find that students who can master at least the first octave of the instrument progress very quickly on clarinet or saxophone in their next year after playing recorder.  I suspect it's because there are so many similarities (the basic fingerings, breathing, etc.).
I have also noticed that beginner flute players struggle tremendously because it's so much harder to produce a tone on a flute.  I know that playing a single-reed instrument is obviously different than a fipple flute but it's a similar shape and size and students seem to adapt quickly.  The concert (""band"") flute is quite different and in my experience, harder.  Flute students at this age (10 or 11 years) seem to more frequently lose interest as their reed-playing classmates advance beyond their skill level.
I'd like to be able to give all the students a chance to learn some rudimentary skills for flute playing, too.
I'm curious... does there exist a simple instrument that could do for the flute what the recorder does for clarinet and saxophone?  Is there such thing as a ""transverse recorder,"" say?

Learning cello fingerings without owning one
Okay this is going to be a weird question but bear with me, I promise I'm not crazy.
Let's say I really wanted to learn cello. Now due to the fact I am not currently able to rent/buy a cello, this creates a dilemma. Now as a trumpet player who has been playing for about five years, I know that if I want to get a piece under my fingers, there are exercises I can do, even when I don't have my trumpet available (e.g. simply tapping my fingers against my leg).
My question is if what I cared about practicing was fingerings (not bowing because the trouble I have is with fingering; my bowing skills are passable) would there be a way to start practicing that without the instrument?
(if this is a bad question leave a comment and I will edit)


**Assistant:**
Well, I suppose you could mock up a [PRODUCT] fingerboard on a yardstick or the like. You could mark off the distance between fingers, and practice getting used to the distances. You can buy a decal that's meant to be applied to the fingerboard, and stick it on your proxy.As long as we're on crazy ideas: You could see if a music store has a neck from an irreparably damaged [PRODUCT] and practice on that.But I must caution, along with the commenters, against doing this. The common theme among the comments is: the main thing to learn is not just which finger to use, but where to put it, down to the millimeter. On fretted instruments, you can place your finger a mm higher or lower and it makes no difference, the fret stops the string; on fretless instruments it would change the pitch. This is not something you teach your cognitive brain (""B = 1, C# = 3""), but your so-called ""muscle memory"" (really a different part of your brain), and it's hard to learn and much much harder to un-learn. Silently fingering on a board or yardstick, even one with finger positions marked precisely, would put your thumb too close or far away from your other fingers, giving you the wrong shape for your hand overall. Even silently practicing on a broken [PRODUCT] neck would feel different if there are no strings.It seems your motivation is to make the best use of your time: for some reason you don't have access to a real [PRODUCT] yet, but want to learn something in such a way that it will save time once you get one. Practicing with your hand in the wrong shape will cost you time rather than save it. If at all possible, get your hands on a real [PRODUCT]. A [PRODUCT] can be had for about $800 USD (don't waste time and money on anything you find cheaper), or you could of course rent an instrument for a few months.And if you want to make the best use of your time, get a teacher. I highly doubt that your bowing is in fact ""passable."" The bow hand, wrist, forearm, and upper arm move and interact in complex ways; I've seen some teaching systems that spend 6 months just training you to hold and move a dowel rod, while making minute adjustments to the position of each finger, motion of the wrist, etc., before giving you the real bow. I would encourage you to start your learning by plucking the strings (""pizzicato"") and learn these bow skills gradually. Again, these are hard enough to learn correctly, very hard to know what you're doing wrong without a teacher's help, and very hard to unlearn."

In-ear monitoring on a budget, what gear should I look at?
I'm playing in a band (drums, bass, guitar, keys + 2 singers), and we are considering putting together an in ear system.
The main problem is small venues, everyone is close to the drummer, and we can't really hear ourselves. Wedges are not always an option, the volume is also not great for our ears. This is the worst for singers as they need to ""intonate themselves"".
I spent the past few days exploring the options, and I can't really see a good solution without a copious amount of gear (not even just price, but sheer amount of stuff). To understand my frustration with this, I'm the guitarist, for now I go there with a modeller unit and my guitar, hand the output to the sound guy, and I'm set.
My goal is to allow everyone to listen to the mix of instruments they preferr in their monitors.
My understanding is, that to achieve this, we need:

A digital mixer with at least number of musicians + 1 (to front of house) outputs.
1 transmitter for each musician.
1 receiver for each musician.
1 pair of in-ears for each musician.

My question is, is there any way to simplify this? For people who are playing with in-ears, how would you get started with this?


**Assistant:**
Disclaimer: I'm an instrumentalist, not an audio engineer; I'm writing from my consumption of sound systems, not experience running them.Let's agree that the ideal, if you had unlimited funds and unlimited time and space to transport and set up gear, would be in-ear monitoring with a system like Aviom that gives each performer direct individual control of their own mix, with their own personal unit to adjust the level they get of every signal. These are often paired with in-ear monitoring, but as far as I know there's no reason they can't be used with wedges, or that the ""old way"" can't be used with in-ear.There are probably many other benefits of this kind of system, but as a performer, the main thing I experienced was ""cutting out the middle man."" In the days of wedges, I always had to bug the sound guy for ""a little more of me... ok, a little more yet... well, maybe that's too much... Oh holy crap the guitarist just showed up late and plugged in and he's incredibly hot, can you pull him way down?... well, I didn't mean all the way out of the mix..."" Multiply that times each person on stage, and it makes for a very long sound check, and invariably I'd wind up just shutting up and making do with something less than ideal. This issue, of control, is separate from the issues of in-ear monitoring vs wedges (you can't both get your mic hot enough, hear enough of yourself, and avoid feedback).Now, as far as I know, there's no reason you couldn't use in-ear monitoring with the ""bug the sound guy"" model. As long as the mixing board has enough aux sends for everyone, you simply run those to the stage and plug in in-ears where you would have plugged in wedges. (Plus probably some consideration that's beyond my knowledge about accounting for impedance difference.) Price: difference in price between wedges and in-ears. Bulk of gear: reduced since you don't need wedges.I have a feeling you're looking for even more creative solutions, though. ""Get the drummer to play quieter"" is good for a laugh. Jokes aside, sometimes this suggestion betrays an ignorance of genre (not looking at you, Tim, more at actual conversations I've had). Someone says ""Well I know it's possible for a drummer to play quietly enough for the space and for the rest of the band; I was in a coffeeshop the other day and there was a jazz combo and the drummer was just using brushes, it was so delicate and tasteful!"" And doesn't recognize that if you're working in a pop-rock, vaguely Blink-182 context, it's essentially a different instrument, just as much as the coffeshop's upright bass is from the electric.I've always found that the solution that fits the room and the style best is to fully enclose the drummer in a [PRODUCT]—you know, Lexan around the front and sides, padded panels behind and on top. Then the drummer can wale away to their hearts content, the output can be miced, mixed, and balanced perfectly to suit the space, and the monitors can contain as much or as little of the drums as needed. These [PRODUCT] certainly cost something (and might mean buying more mics as well, which at some point might start meaning a mixing board with more channels), and they certainly take up some space and time to lug around and set up, but still less of both than an Aviom system."

How do they get guitars to sound so great on tv?
When playing acoustic guitar sometimes it is very difficult to hear certain notes or certain slaps or chords. With shows like American Idol or America's Got Talent, for instance this video:

                
            
I do not see a microphone anywhere near Klafford’s acoustic guitar yet in this video you can clearly hear his acoustic so well. It cannot be that his voice mic is picking up the strumming patterns of the guitar, or is it?
How can I get an acoustic sound so clear, similar to this video? Here is another example from a singer named Alejandro Aranda from American Idol:

                
            
Similarly, you can hear his acoustic sounds very well but I do not see a mic anywhere near his guitar. Both examples don't seem to be playing the acoustic via an amp either. What gives, and what can I use to do something similar? Should I be purchasing a mic for an acoustic guitar?


**Assistant:**
The first hint is that they both sound like an 'electro-acoustic' [especially the second one] with an internal piezo-type pickup & the second is you can see the cable out to what is probably a radio transmitter pack taped to the back of the guitar or hidden in the player's clothing.You can pick up a cheap one for not a lot of money on Amazon or anywhere. Same as most things, you tend to get what you pay for. I doubt the ones the TV show uses are so cheap.I didn't go so far as to try to see exactly what guitar each is using & whether it's already sold with 'plug-in' capabilityYou can also get [PRODUCT], either internal or external. The best of these costs as much, or more than, the guitar.I've used a [PRODUCT] in a similar way [when I was strapped for a [PRODUCT] to use - it's beautiful, but it's an omni so suffers from spill] but ideally, you'd want their [PRODUCT] to do this live.It doesn't look quite so pretty as an internal, but by heck it sounds good."

You may want to have look at the [PRODUCT]. Each key is sensitive to pressure, to up/down-movements and to left-right-movements. I never touched one, but according the manufacturer the left-right-movement gives you the pitch bend you want."

Singing with music through headphones
I am taking singing lessons and also using apps to complement my training.
My teacher recommends against singing with headphones on. This article also explains clearly why I should not use headphones when singing, as that would make me perceive my singing as lower.
However, all the singing apps that I found (and I tried 5 or 6) ask that I use wired earbuds, because that's the only way for the app to hear my voice alone, without hearing the sound made by the app. Indeed, most of these apps essentially play a note that I have to match with my voice.
How can I reconcile the 2? Is it ok to practice with the apps, maybe if I put only one of the 2 earbuds?


**Assistant:**
People who sing along to music while wearing [PRODUCT] sound terrible because they’ve generally got the music so loud they can’t hear themselves.The article correctly points out that singers wear [PRODUCT] on stage and [PRODUCT] in a recording studio, and that this is not an issue because they are monitoring the microphone into which they are singing.The article also points out, correctly, that the way you hear your own voice is different from how everyone else hears it. And it’s correct that the reason is because the sound of your voice travels through bone and the softer tissues of your head.However, that is in addition to traveling through the air between your mouth and your ears.The difference in your perception is in the balance of frequencies constituent to your voice, not the fundamental frequency itself. That’s a difference in timbre, not pitch. The article got that dead wrong. I’ll grant that lower frequencies are emphasized, and perhaps that’s why the author says it’s “lower”, but that is conflating timbre with pitch.Talk to your teacher about why [PRODUCT] are supposedly bad. It is probably because you can’t hear yourself well.If you’ve got a mixer or audio interface and a microphone, you could mix the accompaniment with your own voice. That’s how it’s handled on stage and in the studio.If not, you could always plug one ear with your finger under the [PRODUCT], only use one [PRODUCT], or use [PRODUCT] ([PRODUCT]). Singers sometimes plug one ear when singing in harmony so they hear themselves above the other voices. That technique may work for you as well."

Why is this a G7b9?

My understanding is that one approach to naming a chord is to first identify the root. However in this case, if this is really a G7b9, the root 'G' does not appear in the chord. How am I supposed to tell that this is really a G7b9?
I do know that the function of the chord matters i.e. this is really just a V-I cadence. So I guess in that sense, I understand why one might call this a G7b9. But by looking at the chord in isolation (without the context of the following C major chord), can we tell that this is a G7b9?


**Assistant:**
What jazz pianists mainly do is not write chord symbols for given notes. It's the other way around: what they do is, look at already written chord symbols (or even better, know the changes without staring at a music sheet) and make an artistic contribution by coming up with notes. Or a jazz pianist may even improvise everything about the chords and their realization, but now you're reading a [PRODUCT] that has chord symbols and staff notation. If the [PRODUCT] is about jazz piano, written for aspiring instrumentalist, then I think the examples in the [PRODUCT] should be looked at like this:The chord symbols do not try to be a theoretical description of the notes. And the notes don't try to be a theoretical explanation of what the chord symbols mean. The notes are an example of one possible practical realization of the chord symbols. And not just practical, but even an artistic, tasteful realization that the player subjectively likes.What comes to this particular [PRODUCT], [PRODUCT], the author has in a way formalized the jazz practice of approximating ""official"" changes and improvising the final details on the fly. Whatever kind of major chord it is, if it's not a dominant chord, [PRODUCT] uses ∆ as a generic symbol. Quote from the introduction of the [PRODUCT]: (which I recommend reading, if you're using the [PRODUCT])The unhappy fact that the chord symbols C, C∆, Cmaj7, CM7, C6, and C69all mean pretty much the same thing and are often used interchangeablycan be discouraging to a beginner. In this [PRODUCT], I’ll use the ∆symbol for all major chords.(Note how that confusing and unusual notation was intended to be good for beginners!?)And since this is now the accepted answer, I'll adress your question just to make it clear.How am I supposed to tell that this is really a G7b9Like explained above, ""G7b9"" meant something that was assumed to be given in the lead sheet. Or actually, even an approximation of what there might be in an actual lead sheet, since [PRODUCT] combines many chord types under a generic symbol like ∆. So, whatever notes are written on the stave, that's [PRODUCT]'s artistic choice of what you could play - and he chose to use a rootless voicing in his example.To understand [PRODUCT]'s enharmonic spellings, you need to know how he selects scales to use, and the spellings may not be based on the key signature of the current key. It's explained in the [PRODUCT], but an example is in the question Db in realization of ""A7alt"" in [PRODUCT]'s [PRODUCT]But that's not all. The spelling of b9 of G7b9 as G# does not follow [PRODUCT]'s own logic. Look at Figure 9-28 on page 76. If you should equate the G7b9 chord with a G half-whole diminished scale, then there is no G# in that scale - if written according to how [PRODUCT] presents it in chapter 9. But the G# is not a bad thing, because it lets you clearly see the E major triad there. Which might be why [PRODUCT] made the mistake of not following his own scale system. Maybe he simply looked at the notes as an E major triad and wrote down what he saw.EDIT. The following is my original thoughts about the G# spelling, before reading the [PRODUCT]:What comes to the enharmonic spelling of the G# note, if it's ""b9"", shouldn't it be an Ab? I see that E major triad as something that a jazz player would actually think about, a pianist, guitarist or a sax player just the same. When you see the chord symbol - a dominant chord - you might think ""I'll play a major triad rooted a minor third below the dominant's root"". So: you see ""G7"", you play an E major triad over it. If you want to advice the reader to look at it as an E major triad, then the spelling E - G# - B is exactly right and proper and correct.If you think about a half-whole diminished scale over a dominant chord, which is a common style in jazz, then you can take any chord that's found in the scale and move it up and down in steps of three semitones, and you'll stay within the diminished scale. For example, take a G major, you can move that in steps of three semitones: G major, E major, C# major, Bb major. Worrying about ""correct"" enharmonic spellings for these is completely missing the point of what you should be thinking about here. In any case, as a jazz soloist, you're trying to make the listener feel ambiguous about the harmony and come up with things that could enharmonically exist in many different keys although maybe with different names ... the final ""correct"" spelling, with the advantage of hindsight of knowing where the harmony actually eventually went, might be different from how it's good to think about it while playing."

Plateau while learning piano sight-reading
As a 12 year old I had piano lessons for several months until the teacher retired due to ill health and I never kept going with lessons (which I've regretted ever since). On the plus side I've always remembered how to read music.
Fast forward nearly 40 years and I'd like to learn piano again. I bought a keyboard many years ago which spends most of its time gathering dust, but every couple of years I get it out with a view to learning again, spend a couple of months on it, but always hit a plateau.
I'm able to play basic pieces such as nursery rhymes and children's/beginner's pieces with simple rhythms, and I have no difficulty with the first 3 sight reading books in the ""Accelerated Piano Adventures for older beginners"" series, whose exercises again consist of fairly simple rhythms and note combinations.
However as soon as I tackle something a little more complex then it seems to stump me, for example the ""Really Easy Piano"" book series. Here, any semblance of sight reading goes out of the window and I seem to spend all my time stopping on each beat to figure out the notes. It's painfully slow and I can spend hours doing this with a single piece, with little overall progress. Sometimes I might eventually manage to play part of a piece, but that's only because I've spent so long going over it again and again that I've learnt that section off by heart and am playing from memory.
It's a very frustrating experience, so what can I do to improve my sight reading? Should I consider taking lessons, or am I at the stage where I just need to practice, practice, practice and work my way through more and more books (sight reading or otherwise)?!
As requested below, here's an example page from the aforementioned sight reading book 3: 
And here's another from one of the ""Really Easy Piano"" books: 


**Assistant:**
The two pieces given as examples make significantly different demands on the reader. This post will be devoted to addressing those differences. For improving sight reading in the more broad sense, my own ""philosophy"" is outlined in Acquiring advanced level sight reading. Although the question may not seem directly relevant, my answer will also apply at the basic level being worked through.""as soon as I tackle something a little more complex""First of all, rest assured that the arrangement of ""Thank You for the Music"" is not ""a little more complex"" than that of ""Night of the Tarantella"" — it's a lot more complex. Some comparisons:""Night"" is written such that once your hands are in place, neither has to move; ""Thank You"" requires both hands to move around the keyboard.Because ""Night"" keeps your hands in one place, fingering — which finger to use on which key — is not a concern; ""Thank You"" requires several different fingering techniques, not all of which are at a beginning level.""Night"" has no sharps or flats in the key signature or as accidentals (written next to the notes); ""Thank You"" has both.In ""Night"", the left hand always strikes a chord on a strong beat and at the same time that the right hand also strikes a key — that is, the left hand is rhythmically tied to the right hand; in ""Thank You"" the hands are significantly independent of each other rhythmically.""Night"" incorporates several identifiable patterns of pitch and rhythm; ""Thank You"" does not.If you're counting ""in 6"", every note and chord in ""Night"" occurs ""on the beat""; ""Thank You"" is heavily syncopated.""Thank You"" requires that one hand simultaneously hold a note while moving others (see the last line, first two measures, right hand).Another factor that may or may not be at play here: ""Night"" was written for the [PRODUCT] it's in, so probably unfamiliar beforehand; ""Thank You"" is a recognizable tune, but the piano arrangement may sound different enough to create confusion or uncertainty.How to practice toward ""Thank You for the Music""Here I refer to the post linked earlier. Below are the steps recommended in that post, applied to the specific matter at hand.Read lots and lots and lots of simple music, By continuing to read ""dead simple"" music (the easier the better, IMO), the various problems of ""Thank You"" can be encountered individually, in simpler contexts, so they can be conquered one at a time and better learned before moving on.Practice scales, chords, arpeggios, and common chord progressions. To make the leap from ""Night"" to ""Thank You"", this part you could arguably skip; it's of only indirect relevance. However, practicing and memorizing the D major and B minor scales, both of which contain F# and C#, can assist in keeping track of the key signature.Practice rhythm. This one is essential for ""Thank You"". There are whole [PRODUCT] dedicated to rhythm exercises, and many [PRODUCT] also include them. My personal favorite is [PRODUCT] by [PRODUCT] (Belmont University Faculty Page).1 It can be ordered from the author and might also be found at sites or stores that sell used [PRODUCT]. It's also beneficial to, say, clap the right hand and then the left hand (or vice versa) of a piece before trying to play it.Study music theory. Like scales/chords, this is less directly relevant here, but can offer some insight into why the various accidentals are there, which in turn can help ease the reading.Extra bonus suggestion. I really, really, really like the [PRODUCT] [PRODUCT], compiled by [PRODUCT] (Amazon). The pieces are graded — meaning, they progress from easier to harder — and they move from roughly the level of ""Night"" to something closer to (but short of) ""Thank You"".1 Not to be confused with Rory Stuart's [PRODUCT] by the same name. I know nothing about that [PRODUCT]."

What's wrong with my strategy of recording two groups of 50 chorus members singing to an accompaniment over Zoom, and then mixing everything together?
I direct a school-aged chorus of 100 students, divided equally into sections A and B.  The two sections sing different parts of 2-part arrangements.  Our COVID restrictions this year state that: (1) I cannot have more than 50 students in the rehearsal space at once, and (2) I can not have students from different section in the space at the same time.  So I either have all of A, or all of B, for each rehearsal.  Further, I am not permitted to hold any live, in-person performances.  Even with all this in mind, the students have enjoyed singing and want to share what they are capable of.  I'm planning to produce a recording of their singing and am planning to try it like this...
I have at my disposal enough devices (chromebooks, ipads, etc) to supply each student with one.  Here is my plan.  I'm looking for ways that this may fail before I try it with 50 kids.

On Day 1, Record the accompaniment only with my accompanist and me in the empty rehearsal space.
On Day 2, invite Section A into the rehearsal space.  I'll host a Zoom session, invite all the students, mute them, and instruct them to put on headphones (we have enough).  From the device hosting the Zoom, I'll play the accompaniment file.  They will all hear it in their headphones and be able to sing along.  If I also listen to the file as a participant in the zoom, not the host, I should experience exactly the same latency as them when I conduct, and so we will all be in sync and hearing the accompaniment at the exact same time.  I'll use a separate device to record their singing.
On Day 3, I'll repeat this process with Section B.
After the recording days, I'll use ProTools or GarageBand to mix the accompaniment, section A, and section B together.  This will not result in a perfect studio recording (obviously), but it should be a reasonable ""capture"" of their performance.

In what ways is my strategy most likely to fail, has anyone tried anything similar, and are there any additional strategies that I might be able to employ?


**Assistant:**
I definitely have my doubts about the approach. (Also, TLDR spoiler: It's not really a new problem, and there are other solutions.) Among the problems a pessimist could imagine:On recording day, you open yourself up to ""My device isn't working/ran out of batteries/my headphones aren't working/I'm having trouble with the wifi"" etc. times 50. The odds that the technology co-operates smoothly are slim, and rehearsal time will probably be lost.The assumption that everyone's latency will be equal is not a given. It can be affected not just by internet connection, but (I imagine) by issues local to each device.50 devices all trying to access what is probably the same router might cause their own issues (disparate latencies, or even a traffic jam). They might even create issues within Zoom's logic handling a 50-person call.But ultimately this isn't a new problem. Any time anyone wants to add a choir or orchestra to an existing track, they face the question: How do I provide monitoring to a large ensemble? How can I help them stay in time with the existing track?Unless you have the ability to provide in-ear monitoring to that many people, the solution is normally to just give the conductor headphones and trust the ensemble to follow them. With the disclaimer that I'm a performer, not a recording engineer, I imagine I'd:Record the accompaniment. I might even treat this as a ""scratch track,"" to be replaced later. If there are complex rubato or tempo changes, I might even record myself counting out loud so that I can synchronize my later conducting, preferably in a way that isolates this from the piano track.On recording day, I would try to provide the piano track in normal speakers so the choir has its support for intonation and timing. I would have my own counting in-ear and would conduct.If everything syncs up well, great; if necessary I might do a ""final recording"" of the accompaniment to accomodate any fluctuation that happened in the choir recordings.I seriously wonder whether it's better to record part A and part B separately... or to do half of A with half of B, then the other halves? There are obvious pros and cons. In a sectional, each part can hear itself well. But they're missing cues from the other part and can't tune against it. And I wonder whether which method would yield more problems in synchronization...Update: Oh, and I'd definitely advise doing the whole project, from the start, in your [PRODUCT], [PRODUCT] or [PRODUCT] or even [PRODUCT]. If you were to try something like ""Record Part A on some [PRODUCT], record Part B, then try to sync them up in post,"" that's a tricky business. Any concern about synchronizing the bleed-through of the accompaniment will be minimized if the [PRODUCT] can take care of the relative timing of the tracks; then presumably the two copies of bleed-through will be perfectly aligned and not be a problem.I guess this makes my suggestion of treating it as ""scratch piano"" a bad one. Maybe shoot for finished piano right off the bat. And if you count out loud for your own benefit, this would have to be fully isolated from the piano. Another approach: If your [PRODUCT] supports video, you could capture video of yourself conducting at the same time as recording the pianist, then reference this when conducting the choir."

What is the quietest way to practice trumpet that is still doable?
I'm in a place where even playing with a mute is too loud. I've heard some good things about silent brass devices. But I was wondering how quiet can you physically get with trumpet and still maintain a daily practice without making it too hard too play?


**Assistant:**
A regular [PRODUCT] changes the colour of the sound. A [PRODUCT] (like the [PRODUCT] one I've used for years) won't silence you but it substantially reduces the produced volume. The instrument does ""feel"" different when the [PRODUCT] is inserted - there's more back pressure and the intonation of some of the lower notes goes off a bit. But it still feels like a trumpet.Using the [PRODUCT] means I can play in my car or in a very small room where the volume would otherwise be absolutely crushing, so the [PRODUCT] makes almost any space into a possible rehearsal space.Provided you practise at a reasonable time of day and don't go on for hours, you should be able to play every day without reasonable complaints.If you do use a [PRODUCT] regularly, do try to make some opportunity to play unmuted too; join a band or find a space you can play in without disturbing others. Otherwise you forget how the open instrument behaves.Best thing to do would be to try out a [PRODUCT] for yourself. Borrow one if you can or get one on approval. Don't rely on just playing it in a shop - you really need to live with it for a bit to see how you get on with it."

Did Renaissance composers work from a full score?
When I look at manuscripts and original publications from composers of Renaissance polyphony, I tend to find part-books, not scores.  So I would see a soprano book, an alto book, and so on.   When I see a score, it has usually been edited many years later and put into score format.
This leads me to wonder, did composers like Palestrina even write from a score?  And if not, how on earth did they work from separate part-books to write complex counterpoint?  Do scores in their writing exist that people can examine today?


**Assistant:**
The brief answer is no, at least nothing like the modern sense.The more nuanced answer is sort of and sometimes.First, let's note that score format did exist historically early on. Almost all polyphonic Western music from its earliest forms (ca. late 8th or early 9th century) to the early 1200s was in score format. (See, for example, Notre Dame polyphony, as in this example by Perotin.) The introduction of clear rhythmic notation around that time allowed polyphonic parts to be split into choirbook or partbook formats. I think the common assumption among historians (though I don't know if we have any contemporary documentary testimony to this effect) is that scores began to decline after ca. 1225 because choirbook and partbook formats required less space to write music. As musical styles of the time often had a part or parts moving much slower than other parts, there was a lot of wasted space in a score with the slower part that had fewer notes.The development of the motet (which emphasized some independence of parts, including eventually completely separate texts) also was involved in the emergence of choirbook format -- where all the parts are written out in separate places on two facing pages of a book, so that a choir gathered around could simultaneously read the parts. However, other genres continued to be written in vertical parts (sometimes more-or-less aligned) throughout the 13th century and occasionally beyond.But the modern score notion first starts showing up in instrumental music of the 14th century, even including regular barlines. This is a somewhat rare practice and confined only to instrumental music. It's not until the mid-1500s that we begin to see similar examples of scores in vocal music, and they don't start to become standard until around 1600.So, there are several centuries there where scores are quite uncommon. How did composers compose?The classic study on this topic is [PRODUCT] (Oxford, 1998). If you want to read about the rather fragmentary evidence in terms of extant artifacts, sketches, fair copies, revised versions, etc. of renaissance composers, this book was the first to really look at a lot of it in depth. It built on [PRODUCT] groundbreaking article a decade earlier on the compositional process of Cipriano de Rore.Among other things, [PRODUCT] clearly shows that composers could and did work without scores. (Through much of the 20th century, a lot of music historians had asserted -- without evidence -- that the complexity of renaissance music simply implied that composers must have had and used scores, but like many autographs of later composers, these were simply lost to time. All we had left were the works of scribes and printers.)[PRODUCT] showed this first through the discussion of a set of partbooks in the hand of Cipriano de Rore, which display sketches, mistakes worked out, etc., all in the partbooks themselves. Clearly Rore was capable of thinking and composing in multiple parts and putting them directly into partbooks.But there was more than that. The partbooks also had an affidavit of authenticity penned by composer and organist Luzzasco Luzzaschi, who discusses a cartella that Rore apparently used while writing compositions, which had been gifted to him. While that particular cartella doesn't survive, it likely referred to a slate tablet (as phoog discussed), though wax tablets were also used. As discussed in [PRODUCT], fragments of these have been discovered in archives and archaeological digs: some of them have pre-drawn staves on them (often 10 lines) and some have even been found with a few notes scribbled on them. We also have iconographical evidence of this practice (e.g., in illustrations showing composers with a cartella).These were clearly not large enough to notate a complete piece. [PRODUCT] argues that they were primarily used for solving more contrapuntally complex segments of music (like coordinated points of imitation). Those could then be transferred to partbooks or choirbooks, and a transitional passage could be composed leading toward the next more complex section. [PRODUCT] argues based on documentary evidence (mistakes in partbook drafts, other compositional drafts, and sketches found in marginalia on other manuscripts) that this was the likely mode of composition; the higher rate of errors and part-writing problems in transitional passages seems to support such a methodology.Note that the fragments that would have been written on the slate or in the margin of some scrap paper weren't really ""score"" in the modern sense, but what [PRODUCT] calls quasi-score, with parts jumbled together often -- generally without barlines and not always vertically aligned well -- on a 10-line staff (or staves) that could allow the full standard Guidonian gamut of the time.Another well-attested practice from the time is having choirs actually sing the pieces, with the composer making corrections based on the performance. This is likely one reason why almost without exception renaissance vocal composers were also prominent singers in choirs themselves. We have accounts of several composers ""workshopping"" their pieces like this (including prominent composers like Josquin), and perhaps this process was used more actively during the compositional process for some.For some genres, it may have been common practice to compose a two-voice structure first (or even a single voice, to which a second was added, like a cantus firmus), then compose a third voice (or more) against that structure, making modifications to the existing voices where necessary. This could help contain the variables in free composition without a score. We have accounts from theoretical treatises stating that this was the ""old way"" of composing, though how common or practical it was in renaissance counterpoint is an open question.But we also need to confront the other issue with understanding historical authorship processes, which is that human memory was simply different (and used in different ways) at a time when books were expensive and difficult to make. (Every time I see a medieval manuscript, I immediately think of how many cows or sheep had to die to make the thing, and how many laborious hours went into scraping and stretching and preparing the parchment even before scribes made any annotations.)We have accounts of Thomas Aquinas, for example, supposedly dictating separate works to different scribes all at the same time. For many years, these were viewed as simple exaggeration, but Mary Carruthers challenged that thesis in The Book of Memory (first published in 1992). Through painstaking documentation of medieval treatises on memory techniques and processes of working with written words she began to reconstruct the medieval ""Art of Memory,"" a set of practices that greatly influenced the way medieval and renaissance people read and also how they wrote. At a time when visiting a book in another monastery might be the only time you ever saw the book, the ability to effectively memorize it was essential.In a culture where written books were such a luxury, it would not be uncommon for a skilled person like Aquinas to compose an entire chapter or perhaps even an entire treatise in his head at once, to have it effectively ""memorized"" so he could work over it and revise it in his head, only then to take it to a scribe who could put it to parchment. (Keep in mind how much was memorized at this time by even your average monk, who would chant/recite the entire book of Psalms from memory, often on a biweekly cycle, for example. Obviously various tricks and techniques would be developed to facilitate the memorization process.)There's little doubt that music composers were able to work much the same way, and we have accounts at least of composers spending time working out pieces in their head, perhaps punctuated by work with the slates or whatever for particularly complex passages. We know this because performers apparently could do it from choirbooks or even partbooks. We have accounts of organists and other musicians at job interviews from the 16th century being asked to play motets (even up to six parts!) at sight from a choirbook. According to many sources, this was a common expectation particularly of organists to be able to not only work with their own music but to study and learn the music of others. Frequently even theory treatises of the time would give examples in choirbook format, assuming the reader could piece them together (though we begin to see more score formats emerge there in the late 1500s, first in examples with more than two or three parts). A final piece of evidence that a significant portion of music must have been composed directly into partbooks is Nicola Vicentino's instructions for checking for part-writing errors (like parallel octaves and fifths), where he encourages each part to be checked individually with each other part, note by note. The phrasing about ""part by part"" clearly seems to imply that a student normally would not have a score. (A good account of sources about this can be found in Anne Smith, The Performance of 16th-Century Music: Learning from the Theorists (2012), particularly Chapter 2 on ""Part-Book versus Score Culture."")Such accounts may seem somewhat incredible, until you think about how mystifying it is to a beginning student to see a pianist read four-voice SATB open score along with bits of the two staves of the accompaniment all at the same time, a rather common skill for choral accompanists. It takes practice, but it seems rather ""natural"" once you can do it. Good conductors can often extract information from a much larger score in real-time or even play a version at the piano too. I myself became somewhat adept at one time at reading two voices concurrently from separate parts (and have occasionally done the fun exercise of trying to condense a four-hand piano piece into something playable myself), and I've certainly puzzled out short sections of a choirbook piece with maybe three or four parts in my head when looking at a manuscript in a library... though the thought of actually playing through a choirbook format with four or more parts at sight seems quite daunting to me too. But it's apparently a learned skill, which we know organists of the time were asked to do, so talented composers during the renaissance likely had it as well."

I'm having issues intonating my old electric guitar, my acoustic is apparently not intonated but it sounds fine?
I recently took out my old childhood Fender squier to hopefully fix it up and begin playing it again. This guitar hadn't been strung, worked on or played since about 2007. I restrung it, but after tuning it I noticed it sounded like shit. So, I realized I needed to intonate the guitar. I watched a tutorial and compared the sound of the open string to the 12th harmonic, and according to the tuners, the 12th harmonics were always either wildly flat or wildly sharp... like if I were to try to intonate the guitar I'd have to either bring the saddles way beyond the length of the screw or back past the bridge. So I know something is off, but I know next to nothing about repairing guitars (trying to learn rather than taking it to a shop).
So I gave up on that for the night and started playing my acoustic guitar that I regularly play. It hasn't been strung in a couple years, but it sounds okay when I play along to songs. I thought I'd test out its intonation and also noticed the same thing with my acoustic- it is either wildly flat or sharp.
So I figure I am doing something wrong here and thought I'd ask for advice. Thanks in advance.


**Assistant:**
It is important that before you even try and set your intonation you make sure that the truss rod and neck relief are properly set with the guitar under string tension because a poorly adjusted truss rod will affect intonation and make the guitar difficult to play or maybe even unplayable. There are plenty of online resources that show how to do this. In a nutshell, with the guitar in tune, [PRODUCT] the first fret, hold down the E string on the fret where the neck meets the body. There should be the slightest gap between the E string and the fret at the halfway point between the [PRODUCT] and the held fret. If it touches the rod is too tight and if there is a big gap the rod is too loose. Look for a good video for a more detailed explanation on this.Once that is done, you can try and set the intonation. The Fender website is correct but you are misreading the information there. Use an [PRODUCT] to tune the 12th fret harmonic. Now compare it to the fretted 12th fret. If the fretted 12th fret is sharper than the harmonic then the string needs to be lengthened by moving the saddle away from the neck and vice versa if it is flatter than the harmonic. After moving the saddle, re-tune the harmonic and repeat the procedure till they match. Do this with all six strings and you should be ok."

Route mono to Left or Right instead of centered in FL Studio?
This is my first post and hope I am on topic. In a DAW like Reaper when you record Mono mic on a track, it is by default centered. Same sound is then heard on both speakers.
However, I have been able to route L-Mono to speaker 1 and then same L-Mono input to  speaker 2 separately on 2 tracks in Reaper. In Routing option for a track, you can select 1 to 1 and 1 to 2 and accordingly input mono is routed to only Left  1 or Right 2 output speaker. So that  I can get a feel of two different pieces of music playing thru individual speakers.
Just for an example chords on left speaker in one track  and say some lead piece on right speaker on another track.
However I am trying out another DAW FL Studio 20 and not sure how to achieve the same in that DAW. Does anyone have any idea about the correct settings?
Hope I explained what I am trying to achieve. In case there’s existing QnA, kindly share the link.
Thanks.


**Assistant:**
You're looking for how to pan audio. Assuming you've already figured out how to get your mic into FL studio at all-In the drop down menu where you select your input:Select the appropriate mono (not stereo!) input for your mic. You can do this on as many tracks as you like simultaneously.Use the pan knob to pan this channel left or right (This may look slightly different depending on what mixer layout you have selected):This pans the audio on that channel post-effects. If you want to pan pre-effects, insert a panning [PRODUCT] such as ""[PRODUCT]"" into effects slot 1.I'll note that there is a third panning option in the channel rack, which is only available on recorded audio or virtual instruments (not live audio) and is also pre-effects. I only use it when I want several similar audio clips panned differently and passing through the same mixer channel."

How to access the lower manual and pedalboard on setBfree Organ emulator
I installed the organ emulator setBfree on a Debian GNU/Linux System.

I run it with Jack connected to the simple USB MIDI controller keyboard. This is working fairly well to connect to the upper manual. Though I cannot figure out how to get a connection to the lower manual and pedalboard.

As one can see in the picture, there is only one MIDI input for the instrument. Does anyone know how I can control the other two keyboards? Do I need some CC control programming for this? (There does not seem to be any option relating to this issue in the GUI preferences)


**Assistant:**
According to this reference (sorry in French), the other manuals can be accessed by changing the MIDI channel.The link actually gives a technique, using [PRODUCT] (a very useful program), to map different part of a midi keyboard to the different register."

Pedal Board Routing, using an A/B box in reverse
I'm struggling to get my guitar pedal set up into a sane arrangement.
I've tried the following signal path:
                           -> Comp -> Chorus -> Crunch (A)
                          /                            \
Guitar  ->  Splitter   --<                              -> A/B Box -> Volume Pedal -> Phaser -> Delay -> AMP/CABS
                          \                            /
                           -> Big Muff Distortion ---> (B)

The failure is happening at the Splitter step. I've tried a dozen different (mono) Radio Shack splitters and couplers that I have and I can't get two signals to pass from the guitar to the Comp and Big Muff simultaneously, it only comes through one side of the splitter. I assume I'm using them in reverse, and there's some kind of restriction like a diode only allowing one-way signal. I want to replace the Splitter with something that makes sense, but I don't want to buy another A/B/Both box just to leave the setting on Both.
If you're wondering how I got in this state, I want to keep certain pedals on the back row and never touch them (Big Muff, Comp, Chorus). That's why I'm not running things in a straight line, I'd rather just hit the A/B switch.
I feel like I used some kind of pedal routing thing 10 years ago but I can't recall what it was.
Anything that helps fix this problem without adding much space (increased cost is expected) would be very appreciated, thanks!


**Assistant:**
When you use a Y-cable, which is what I assume you mean by ""splitter"" you lower the impedance of the load downstream. Lowering the impedance may affect the operation of the pedals.I suggest that you first try reversing the order with the ABY box before the split and the splitter after. If that doesn't work, then I suggest getting a [PRODUCT] like the [PRODUCT]."

What is the perfect age for a child to start piano lessons?
My son of 3.5 year old, and my daughter of 1.5 year old, are both showing good ear, musical capabilities and intetests. I am a 19 years experienced guitarist and I am about to start music lessons for them. What can be the best age for them to start the lessons?
Both of them show interest in piano, singing and maybe guitar.


**Assistant:**
There is no best age as in how many years they've been alive!The best time is when they show enough interest and can concentrate and practise well enough to cope with lessons. For some that may be 3, others may never attain an 'age' when that's a viable possibility.So, from that point of view, there will be no concrete answer.As a musician yourself, why not encourage some musicality by providing some instruments appropriate to their capability - size and playability. When you see improvement, and feel (and they feel) that they're ready to be left with a stranger for 20 mins, half an hour, and you can pay for that privilege, that's the age.EDIT: For [PRODUCT] lessons, specifically, (from your header), size would be a salient factor. Ability to stretch several [PRODUCT] keys is a consideration, ability to reach pedals, not so. Perhaps a [PRODUCT] or [PRODUCT] would be appropriate."

How to connect my guitar pedal to a Pioneer DJ mixer?
Is it OK to connect directly my Line 6 PODxt Live pedal to a Pioneer DJ mixer MIC input?
It is not sounding. I did it like this:
I tried doing it by plugging the quarter inch jack into the Pioneer DJ mixer, and that plug comes from my pedal set Line 6 PODxt Live, and it's not sounding yet, even if I turn up the ""Level"" output knob of my pedal pretty high (I was afraid of doing that and break something of the mixer side  because that ""Level"" knob is pretty powerful. I have a 60W amp and I usually use that knob in about 20% of power and that's enough) but even turning that knob of my pedal more than 50% it still didn't sound. What is happening? Should I use my 60W amp as the ""pre-amp"" so the Pioneer DJ mixer hears me playing?
I'm writing this based also on this other question's top answer: Is there a way to connect a guitar to a dj console?
If the solution would be using an RCA-jack cable converter, should that work?
Edit: picture attached showing inputs of the mixer from the back and the model is DDJ T1.



**Assistant:**
The simple rule of thumb is that it is OK to plug microphones to microphone inputs. Things that are not microphones should not go to microphone inputs, unless you use a DI box that is an adapter specially for this purpose.The Pod XT is not a microphone, so it should not go to microphone input. The manual says its outputs are line-level and can be switched between balanced and non-balanced mode. The best match on your mixer is the Aux input, which is line-level non-balanced. You need [PRODUCT] for the connection, and the Pod XT should be set up for non-balanced output."

How can I hang a viola de gamba on the wall?
Will a standard guitar hangar work? And is there a measurement or way to tell if a particular hangar will work for a particular instrument?
Is this a safe way to store my instrument?
I’ve provided a picture for scale.



**Assistant:**
I don't have a fully informed answer, but I'll take a shot at a few:Many guitar [PRODUCT] won't work because their ""fork"" relies on the headstock being wider than the neck. For this instrument, as well as many violins/violas/cellos, the pegbox is the same width as the neck, so it would be the pegs bearing the weight, which maybe isn't a great idea (and might cause it to hang crooked too). Also, a gamba is deeper front-to-back than most guitars; you'd have to make sure the fork ""sticks out"" far enough from the wall.I've seen some that are specifically made for string instruments, like this ""[PRODUCT],"" in which the instrument is more hung by the heel at the back of the pegbox. It still makes me a bit antsy that it could be bumped and fall.Many violin shops, including high-end dealers, hang violins for display. These are often hung by a sort of upside-down ""staple"" of wire that lets you hook the scroll over it. I've seen them not do this with cellos, though, but stand them in wooden [PRODUCT]. I'm not sure whether there's concern, with the heavier instrument, about strain on the scroll? Or whether it just becomes less practical?There's a lot to be said for storing your instrument outside its case—and a lot to be said against it. Right now my daughter's cello is in the middle of the living room, sitting in an [PRODUCT]. This can be adjusted up so high that she can even keep her endpin out; she can practice just by picking it up. Having your instrument ready-to-hand can make it easier to play spontaneously. But it comes at the cost of keeping it less protected: in particular, you have to make sure that the room temperature and humidity are stable and within safe zones for the instrument. It's a lot easier to control humidity inside a case, and if the room temperature changes, the temp inside the case changes more gradually. The instrument is also more vulnerable to accidents on a [PRODUCT], if someone were to walk into it. But if you're satisfied about these concerns, maybe a similar [PRODUCT] could be a good solution. (And useful in concerts, like if you swap between tenor, treble, or bass!)Bottom line, your instrument is safest in a good case, but there can be benefits to having it out on display if you are okay with the precautions."

Does GarageBand have an oscillator and where do I find it?
Does GarageBand have an oscillator/waveform generator like other DAWs such as FL Studio or Cubase?
I'm basically trying to create my own waveforms (to create bass, pads, chords, etc) from scracth, which you usually do using subtractive synthesis (e.g. with an oscillator).
I can't believe GarageBand would lack this key feature, so I'm pretty sure it's just sitting there somewhere waiting for me to find it.
Edit:
Platform: GarageBand for Mac (macOS 12.1 Monterey)
Note: The ""Alchemy Synth"" version of GarageBand for Mac lacks the Synth/waveform generator feature (which is the exact feature i'm looking for); it just allows you to apply presets to existing sounds
Here are some examples from other DAWs of what I'm looking for:
Cubase 3x Oscillator:

FL Studio 3x Oscillator:

You can use third-party [PRODUCT] in Garageband, as long as they are in the [PRODUCT] ([PRODUCT]) format. Unfortunately I can't personally recommend a [PRODUCT] here, since the ones I use are [PRODUCT] only, but I do know that [PRODUCT] is pretty popular, and it looks like it covers your needs. It gives you three oscillators (osc1, osc2, sub) and a variety of ways to modulate the sound."
